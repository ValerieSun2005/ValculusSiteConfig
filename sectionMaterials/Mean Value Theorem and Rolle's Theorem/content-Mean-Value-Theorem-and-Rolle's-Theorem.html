    In this section, we introduce the Mean Value Theorem and Rolle's Theorem.
    Recall the definitions of the <i>average rate of change</i> and the <i>instantaneous</i> rate of change. 
    The average rate of change of the function \(f(x)\) over the interval \([a, b]\) is 
    \[\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} \period\]
    This quantity represents the slope of the secant line to the graph of \(y = f(x)\) 
    from \(x = a\) to \(x = b\) (Figure 1A).
    In contrast, the instantaneous rate of change of \(f(x)\) at \(x = c\) is 
    \[f'(c) \comma \]
    the slope of the tangent line to \(y = f(x)\) at \(x = c\) (Figure 1B).

    Now consider a function \(f\) that is continuous on \([a, b]\) and differentiable on \((a, b).\)
    If \(f(a) = f(b),\) then the average rate of change of \(f\) over \([a, b]\) is \(0.\)
    Then, by 
    <span class="emph">Rolle's Theorem</span>,
    there must be a number \(c\) such that 
    \[a \lt c \lt b \and f'(c) = 0 \period\]

    The graph of a function \(y = f(x)\) is shown in Figure 2.
    We see that \(f\) is continuous on \([a, b]\) and differentiable on \((a, b),\)
    therefore satisfying conditions (1) and (2). 
    Moreover, \(f(a) = f(b) = k,\) so \(f\) meets condition (3).
    Thus, Rolle's theorem guarantees a number \(c,\) \(a \lt c \lt b,\)
    for which \(f'(c) = 0.\) 
    At \(x = c,\) the graph of \(y = f(x)\) has a horizontal tangent. 
    Notice that this tangent line is parallel to the secant line formed 
    by the points \((a, k)\) and \((b, k).\)

            Since \(f(x)\) is a polynomial, it's continuous and differentiable for all \(x.\)
            Moreover, \(f(0) = f(6)\) \(= 2.\) 
            Therefore, \(f\) meets all three conditions of Rolle's Theorem,
            so there must be a number \(c\) in \((0, 6)\) 
            such that \(f'(c) = 0\) (Figure 3).
            Differentiating \(f\) gives 
            \[f'(x) = x^2 - 4x \period \]
            We then have 
            \[
            \ba

            The solution in \((0, 6)\) is \(\boxed{c = 4,}\)

    Let's now discuss the Mean Value Theorem. 
    Suppose that a function \(f\) is continuous on \([a, b]\) and differentiable on \((a, b).\)
    The average rate of change of \(f(x)\) over \(a \leq x \leq b\) is 
    \[\frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} \period \]
    The Mean Value Theorem then guarantees a value \(c\) in \((a, b)\) such that 
    \[f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} \period \]
    <!--figure 4-->
    <figure class="fig-4">
        <img src="../images/Calculus/3/3.1/3.1-4.jpg" alt="">
    </figure>
    Geometrically, the Mean Value Theorem states that at the point \((c, f(c)),\)
    the line tangent to the graph of \(y = f(x)\) is parallel to the secant line 
    formed by the points \((a, f(a))\) and \((b, f(b))\) (Figure 4).
    Thus, Rolle's Theorem is a special case of the Mean Value Theorem for a horizontal tangent.
    Additionally, several values of \(c\) 
    in \((a, b)\) may satisfy the Mean Value Theorem; 
    that is, several tangent lines to the graph of \(y = f(x)\) 
    may be parallel to the secant line formed by \((a, f(a))\) and \((b, f(b)).\)

    An application of the Mean Value Theorem is convicting speeding drivers.
    For example, a driver who travels \(180\) miles in two hours has an average speed of
    \[\overline{v} = \frac{180 \; \textrm{miles}}{2 \; \textrm{hrs}} = 90 \; \textrm{mph} \period\]
    The driver's position function is continuous and differentiable.
    Thus, the Mean Value Theorem guarantees 
    an instant in the driver's journey during which his or her instantaneous speed is \( \overline{v} = 90\) 
    mph.
    This fact can then be used to charge the driver with speeding.
