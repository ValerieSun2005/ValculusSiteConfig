        The average rate of change of \(f(x)\) over \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{\pi}{2}\) is 
        \[\frac{\sin \frac{\pi}{2} - \sin 0}{\frac{\pi}{2} - 0} = 0 \period \] 
        Because \(f(x)\) is continuous on \(0 \leq x \leq \frac{\pi}{2}\) 
        and differentiable on \(0 \lt x \lt \frac{\pi}{2},\)
        the Mean Value Theorem (or Rolle's Theorem, given that the average rate of change is zero)  
        guarantees a value \(c\) such that 
        \[f'(c) = 0 \period\]
        We then have 
        \[f'(c) = 2 \cos(2c) = 0 \implies \boxed{c = \frac{\pi}{4}}\]
        as the value that satisfies the Mean Value Theorem for \(f\) over \([0, \frac{\pi}{2}].\)

        \(\ds f(x) =  3x^2 - 8x + 11 \comma 1 \leq x \leq 4\)
    </div>
    <span>
        The average rate of change of \(f(x)\) over the interval \(1 \leq x \leq 4\) is 
        \[\frac{f(4) - f(1)}{4 - 1} = 7 \period \] 
        \(f(x)\) is a polynomial, so it's continuous over \(1 \leq x \leq 4\) 
        and differentiable over \(1 \lt x \lt 4.\)
        Thus, the Mean Value Theorem guarantees a value \(c\) in \((1, 4)\) such that 
        \[f'(c) = 7 \period\]
        Solving, we have 
        \[
        f'(c) = 6c - 8 = 7 \implies \boxed{c = \frac{5}{2}}
        \]

        \(\ds f(x) = \frac{1}{3} x^3 - x^2 -3x - 15 \comma 0 \leq x \leq 3 \)
    </div>
    <span>
        Since \(f\) is a polynomial, \(f(x)\) is continuous for \(0 \leq x \leq 3\)
        and differentiable for \(0 \lt x \lt 3.\)
        Therefore, the Mean Value Theorem guarantees a value \(c\) in \((0, 3)\)
        such that 
        \[f'(c) = \frac{f(3) - f(0)}{3 - 0} = -3 \period\]
        Moreover, \(f'(x) = x^2 - 2x - 3.\) Then we set \(f'(c) = -3\) to get 
        \[
        \ba 
        f'(c) = c^2 - 2c - 3 &= -3 \\
        c^2 - 2c &= 0 \implies c = 0 \comma c = 2 \period
        \ea 
        \]
        We find \(\boxed{c = 2}\) to be in \((0, 3),\) so this value satisfies the Mean Value Theorem
        for \(f\) over \([0, 3].\)

    </div>
    <span>
        The function \(f(x)\) isn't differentiable at \(x = 2,\)
        so no value satisfies the Mean Value Theorem over \(0 \leq x \leq 4.\)

        \(\ds f(x) = 5e^x \comma 0 \leq x \leq \ln 3\)
    </div>
    <span>
        Exponential functions are continuous and differentiable for all values in their domain.
        Thus, \(f(x)\) is continuous for \(0 \leq x \leq \ln 3\) and 
        differentiable for \(0 \lt x \lt \ln 3.\) 
        The Mean Value Theorem then guarantees a value \(c\) in \((0, \ln 3)\) such that 
        \[f'(c) = \frac{f(\ln 3) - f(0)}{\ln(3) - 0} = \frac{10}{\ln 3} \period\]
        Solving, we have 
        \[
        \ba 
        f'(c) = 5e^c &= \frac{10}{\ln 3} \\[2ex]
        e^c &= \frac{2}{\ln 3} \\[2ex] 
        c &= \boxed{\ln \left( \frac{2}{\ln 3} \right)}
        \ea

    </div>
    <span>
        Since \(f\) is a polynomial, it is continuous on \([-3, 3]\) and differentiable on \((-3, 3).\)
        Thus, the Mean Value Theorem guarantees a value \(c\) in \((-3, 3)\) such that 
        \[f'(c) = \frac{f(3) - f(-3)}{3 - (-3)} = 2 \period\]
        Solving, we have 
        \[
        \ba 
        f'(c) = c^2 - 2c - 1 &= 2 \\
        c^2 - 2c - 3 &= 0 \comma \\
        \ea 
        \]
        whose solution in \((-3, 3)\) is \(\boxed{c = -1 \period}\)

        Consider the function
        \(g(x) = ax^2 + bx,\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are constants.
        Show that \(c = k/2\) satisfies the Mean Value Theorem for \(g\) over \(0 \leq x \leq k.\)
    </div>
    <span>
        Because \(g(x)\) is a polynomial, it's differentiable for all \(x.\)
        Moreover, the average rate of change of \(g\) over \([0, k]\) is 
        \[
        \ba 
        \frac{g(k) - g(0)}{k - 0} &= \frac{ak^2 + bk}{k} \\[2ex]
        &= ak + b \period
        \ea 
        \]
        Therefore, the Mean Value Theorem guarantees a value \(c\) in \((0, k)\) such that
        \[g'(c) = ak + b \period \]
        Solving, we have 
        \[
        \ba 
        g'(c) = 2ac + b &= ak + b \\
        c &= k/2 \period

        (Calculator required.) The amount of snow, in inches, on a road after \(t\) hours is modeled by

        For what value of \(k,\) \(0 \leq k \leq 5,\) is \(s'(k)\) equal to
        the average rate of change of \(s(t)\) over \(0 \leq t \leq 5 \ques\)

        We find the average rate of change of \(s(t)\) over \(0 \leq t \leq 5\) to be 
        \[\frac{s(5) - s(0)}{5 - 0} \approx 0.632 \; \text{inches}/\text{hr} \period\]
        We then have \(s(t) = 0.632\) at \(\boxed{t \approx 2.293 \period}\)

        Let \(f\) be the polynomial defined by
        \(f(x) = x^5 + 6x^3 + 4x + 2.\) 
        Note that \(f(-1) = -9\) and \(f(0) = 2.\)
        Using Rolle's Theorem, show that \(f(x) = 0\) has exactly one real solution.
    </div>
    <span>
        The function \(f(x)\) is a polynomial, so it is continuous for all \(x.\)
        Therefore, because \(f(-1) = -9\) and \(f(0) = 2,\)
        the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees a solution to \(f(x) = 0\)
        within \(-1 \leq x \leq 2.\)
        We now show that \(f\) has no other zeros using a Proof By Contradiction:
        We first start by assuming that \(f\) has two zeros, \(x = a\) and \(x = b.\)
        It then follows that 
        \[f(a) = f(b) = 0 \period\]
        Because \(f\) is a polynomial, it is continuous on \([a, b]\) and differentiable on \((a, b).\)
        Thus, Rolle's Theorem states that a value \(c\) in \((a, b)\) must satisfy \(f'(c) = 0.\)
        We then differentiate \(f(x)\) to find 
        \[f'(c) = 5c^4 + 18c^2 + 4 = 0 \comma\]
        which has no solution.  
        Therefore, we have a contradiction: 
        \(f\) does not satisfy \(f(a) = f(b) = 0,\)
        so Rolle's Theorem cannot be used on \(f.\)
        We conclude, therefore, that \(f\) must only have one zero.
