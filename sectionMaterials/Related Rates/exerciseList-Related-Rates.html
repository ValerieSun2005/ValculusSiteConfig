    A right triangle has legs of lengths \(x\) and \(y.\)
    Length \(x\) is increasing at a rate of \(3\) inches per minute, 
    while length \(y\) remains constant.
    At a certain moment, \(y = 4 \un{in}.\)
    Find the rate at which the triangle's area is changing at this time.
</div>
<span>
    The area of the triangle is 
    \begin{equation} 
    A = \tfrac{1}{2} xy \pd \label{eq:triangle-area}
    \end{equation}
    Quantity \(x\) varies with time, so we treat it as a function of time.
    And \(y\) is constant, so we don't perceive it as depending on time.
    We want to find the rate at which the triangle's area is changing—this represents \(\textDeriv{A}{t}.\)
    And so we differentiate both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:triangle-area}\) with respect to time, 
    using the Chain Rule:
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{A}{t} = \tfrac{1}{2} \deriv{x}{t} y \pd \label{eq:triangle-dA/dt}
    \end{equation}
    Since \(x\) is increasing at \(3 \undiv{in}{min},\) 
    \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 3 \undiv{in}{min};\) 
    and we are interested in the <i>moment</i> at which \(y = 4.\) 
    Plugging these values into \(\eqRefer{eq:triangle-dA/dt}\) gives 
    \[\deriv{A}{t} = \tfrac{1}{2}(3)(4) = 6 \pd\]
    Thus, the triangle's area is increasing at a rate of \(6\) square inches per minute.
    In \(\eqRefer{eq:triangle-area}\) it is important <i>not</i> to plug in \(y = 4\) 
    immediately; we substitute this value <i>after</i> differentiating, as in \(\eqRefer{eq:triangle-dA/dt}.\)

<div>
    A square's sides all are shrinking at a rate of \(2\) inches per minute.
    When each side is \(6\) inches long, how quickly is the square's area decreasing?
</div>
<span>
    Let \(x\) be one of the square's sides.
    Since each side is <i>decreasing</i> at a rate of \(2 \undiv{in}{min},\) 
    we have \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = -2 \undiv{in}{min}.\)
    Let's call \(A\) the square's area; we want to find \(\textDeriv{A}{t},\)
    the rate at which the area changes. 
    We expect this rate to be negative.
    To relate \(x\) and \(A,\) we know 
    \begin{equation} 
    A = x^2 \pd \label{eq:square-A}
    \end{equation}
    Both \(x\) and \(A\) vary with time, so we treat them as functions of time.
    And so we differentiate both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:square-A}\)
    with respect to time (by the Chain Rule), obtaining 
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{A}{t} = 2x \deriv{x}{t} \pd \label{eq:square-dA/dt}
    \end{equation}
    We are interested in the <i>instant</i> at which \(x = 6,\)
    and we are given that \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = -2.\) 
    Thus, we substitute these values in \(\eqRefer{eq:square-dA/dt}\) to get 
    \[\deriv{A}{t} \Big|_{x = 6} = 2(6)(-2) = -24 \pd\]
    We conclude that the square's area is <i>decreasing</i> at a rate of \(24 \un{in}^2/\un{min}.\)

    A rectangle's width is increasing at a rate of \(2\) centimeters per second, 
    and its height is increasing at a rate of \(0.5\) centimeter per second. 
    At what rate is the rectangle's area changing when its width is \(4\) centimeters 
    and its height is \(5\) centimeters?
</div>
<span>
    Let's call \(w\) the rectangle's width and \(h\) its height.
    These suggestive variables decrease the risk of confusion.
    We're given that the width increases at a rate of \(2 \undiv{cm}{sec}\)
    and that the height increases at a rate of \(0.5 \undiv{cm}{sec}.\)
    Thus, \(\textDeriv{w}{t} = 2 \undiv{cm}{sec}\) and \(\textDeriv{h}{t} = 0.5 \undiv{cm}{sec}.\)
    Let \(A\) be the rectangle's area. 
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{A}{t}\) when \(w = 4\) and \(h = 5.\)
    We establish a relationship between these quantities by writing
    \begin{equation} 
    A = wh \pd \label{eq:rectangle-wh}
    \end{equation}
    All three quantities vary with time, so when we differentiate \(\eqRefer{eq:rectangle-wh}\)
    we need the Chain Rule:
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{A}{t} = \deriv{w}{t} \, h + w \deriv{h}{t} \pd \label{eq:rectangle-wh-dA/dt}
    \end{equation}
    We can now substitute the given quantities—namely, \(\textDeriv{w}{t} = 2\) and 
    \(\textDeriv{h}{t} = 0.5.\) 
    We also plug in \(w = 4\) and \(h = 5,\) which correspond to the moment we want. 
    \(\eqRefer{eq:rectangle-wh-dA/dt}\) then becomes 
    \[\deriv{A}{t} = 2(5) + 4(0.5) = 12 \pd\]
    Thus, the rectangle's area is increasing at a rate of \(12 \un{cm}^2/\un{sec}.\)

    If \(y = 2x^2 + 3x\) and \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = -2,\) then find \(\textDeriv{y}{t}\) when \(x = 2.\)
</div>
<span>
    The givens establish that \(x\) is a function of \(t.\)
    The Chain Rule states that 
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{y}{t} = \deriv{y}{x} \deriv{x}{t} \pd \label{eq:chain-rule-dy/dt}
    \end{equation}
    We find \(\textDeriv{y}{x} = 4x + 3,\) and we're given \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = -2.\)
    Plugging these expressions into \(\eqRefer{eq:chain-rule-dy/dt}\) yields 
    \[\deriv{y}{t} = (4x + 3)(-2) = -8x - 6 \pd\]
    When \(x = 2\) we have 
    \[\deriv{y}{t} \Big|_{x = 2} = -8(2) - 6 = \boxed{-22}\]

    If \(y = \sqrt{x + 4}\) and \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 4,\) then find \(\textDeriv{y}{t}\) when \(x = 12.\)
</div>
<span>
    The problem implies that \(x\) is a function of \(t.\)
    By the Chain Rule 
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{y}{t} = \deriv{y}{x} \deriv{x}{t} \pd \label{eq:chain-rule-dy/dt-2}
    \end{equation}
    We find 
    \[\deriv{y}{x} = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{x + 4}} \cma\]
    and we are given \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 4.\)
    Substituting these expressions in \(\eqRefer{eq:chain-rule-dy/dt-2}\) then gives 
    \[\deriv{y}{t} = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{x + 4}} \cdot 4 \pd\]
    When \(x = 12\) 
    \[\deriv{y}{t} \Big|_{x = 12} = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{12 + 4}} \cdot 4 = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\]

    A \(6\)-meter string swings to form an angle \(\theta\) with the vertical, and \(\theta\) extends outward at a rate of \(2\) 
    radians per second. What is the rate of change of the area of the circular sector intercepted by \(\theta \; ?\)
</div>
<span>
    The area of the circular sector that \(\theta\) intercepts is 
    \begin{equation} 
    A = \tfrac{1}{2}(6)^2 \theta \pd \label{eq:sector}
    \end{equation}
    We are given that \(\theta\) increases at a rate of \(2 \undiv{rad}{sec},\)
    so this value is \(\textDeriv{\theta}{t}.\)
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{A}{t}.\)
    Quantities \(\theta\) and \(A\) vary with time, so we treat them each as a function of time.
    We differentiate both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:sector}\) with respect to time, obtaining 
    \[
    \deriv{A}{t} = \tfrac{1}{2} (6)^2 \deriv{\theta}{t} = \tfrac{1}{2} (6)^2 \, (2) = 36 \pd
    \] 
    Thus, the area of the sector is increasing at a rate of \(36 \un{m}^2/\text{sec}.\)

    Water is pumped, at a rate of \(15\) cubic inches per minute, into a cylindrical tank of radius \(5\) inches.
    How fast is the tank's water level rising? 
</div>
<span>
    Let \(r\) be the tank's radius and \(h\) be the water level.
    We relate the volume of the water to \(r\) and \(h\) by 
    \[V = \pi r^2 h \pd\]
    (These quantities represent the <i>water</i>, not the entire tank.)
    We are given \(r = 5 \un{in},\) so we have 
    \begin{equation} 
    V = 25 \pi h \pd \label{eq:water-tank-cylinder}
    \end{equation}
    Since water is pumped in at a rate of \(15 \un{in}^3/\un{min},\)
    this value is \(\textDeriv{V}{t}.\)
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{h}{t}.\)
    We therefore differentiate \(\eqRefer{eq:water-tank-cylinder}\) with respect to time to get 
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{V}{t} = 25 \pi \deriv{h}{t} \pd \label{eq:water-tank-cylinder-dV/dt}
    \end{equation}
    Substituting \(\textDeriv{V}{t} = 15\) in \(\eqRefer{eq:water-tank-cylinder-dV/dt}\) gives 
    \[15 = 25 \pi \deriv{h}{t} \implies \deriv{h}{t} = \frac{3}{5 \pi} \pd\]
    Thus, the tank's water level is rising at a rate of \(3/(5 \pi)\) \(\approx 0.191 \undiv{in}{min}.\)  
    Note that \(\textDeriv{h}{t}\) is constant; it does <i>not</i> change when \(h\) is changed.

    A uniform trough has a cross-sectional area of \(64\) square inches.
    If water is pumped into the trough at a rate of \(7\) cubic inches per second, then
    how quickly is the water level rising?
</div>
<span>
    Let \(V\) be the water's volume and \(h\) be its water level.
    Note that \(\text{volume}\) \(= \text{area}\) \(\times \, \text{height}.\)
    The trough's cross-sectional area is \(64 \un{in}^2,\) so 
    \begin{equation} 
    V = 64 h \pd \label{eq:V-trough}
    \end{equation}
    We are given that water enters the trough at a rate of \(7\) cubic inches per second,
    so this value is \(\textDeriv{V}{t}.\)
    We differentiate both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:V-trough}\) with respect to time, obtaining 
    \[
    \ba 
    \deriv{V}{t} &= 64 \deriv{h}{t} \nl 
    7 &= 64 \deriv{h}{t} \nl 
    \deriv{h}{t} &= \frac{7}{64} \pd
    \ea 
    \]
    Thus, the trough's water level is increasing at a rate of \(7/64\) \(\approx 0.109 \undiv{in}{sec}.\)

    <i>Boyle's Law</i> states that a sample of gas of volume \(V\) exposed to pressure \(P\) 
    obeys the relationship \(PV = C,\) where \(C\) is a constant.
    Many gases obey this law if \(P\) is not too high and the gas's temperature is constant.
    Suppose that a gas has a volume of \(60\) cubic inches
    and is exposed to \(200\) kilopascals of pressure.
    If the pressure is increased at a rate of \(30\) kilopascals per second,
    then find the rate at which the gas's volume decreases.
</div>
<span>
    We are given that \(\textDeriv{P}{t} = 30 \undiv{kPa}{sec}.\)
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{V}{t}\) for this gas when \(V = 60 \un{in}^3\) and \(P = 200 \un{kPa}.\)
    We differentiate both sides of \(PV = C\) with respect to time,
    noting that \(C\) is a constant:
    \begin{align} 
    \deriv{P}{t} \, V + P \deriv{V}{t} &= 0 \nonumber \nl 
    \deriv{V}{t} &= -\frac{V}{P} \deriv{P}{t} \pd \label{eq:gas-diff}
    \end{align}
    We substitute \(V = 60,\) \(P = 200,\) and \(\textDeriv{P}{t} = 30\) in \(\eqRefer{eq:gas-diff}\) 
    to obtain 
    \[\deriv{V}{t} = -\frac{60}{200} \cdot 30 = -9 \pd\]
    Therefore, the gas's volume is <i>decreasing</i> at a rate of \(9 \un{in}^3/\text{sec}.\)

    Two positive charges are located \(r\) meters apart.
    Both charges repel each other by exerting the same force \(F\) on the other
    (<a href="#related-rates-charges">Figure 1</a>), 
    and \(F = 0.4/r^2.\) 
    The force decreases at a rate of \(0.4\) newton per second.
    Find the rate at which \(r\) changes when the charges are \(2\) meters apart.
</div>
<span>
    This problem asserts that \(r\) and \(F\) vary with time.
    Therefore, we treat these quantities as functions of time.
    The force decreases at \(0.4 \undiv{N}{sec},\) 
    so \(\textDeriv{F}{t} = -0.4.\)
    We want \(\textDeriv{r}{t}\) when \(r = 2.\)
    We differentiate the given relationship using the Chain Rule, and we plug in the given \(\textDeriv{F}{t} = -0.4.\)
    Doing so yields 
    \begin{align}
    \deriv{F}{t} &= \deriv{F}{r} \deriv{r}{t} \nonumber \nl 
    -0.4 &= -\frac{0.8}{r^3} \deriv{r}{t} \pd \label{eq:force-diff}
    \end{align}
    In \(\eqRefer{eq:force-diff}\) we plug in the moment of interest—when \(r = 2\)—to get  
    \[-0.4 = -\frac{0.8}{8} \deriv{r}{t} \implies \deriv{r}{t} = 4 \pd\]
    Thus, the distance between the two charges is increasing at a rate of \(4\) meters per second.

    A square-shaped sheet of dough is stretched horizontally at a rate of \(3\) inches per second.
    The vertical length of the sheet then decreases such that the sheet retains an area of \(70\) square inches.
    When the dough's horizontal length is \(14\) inches, how fast is its vertical length decreasing?
</div>
<span>
    Let \(x\) be the dough's horizontal length and \(y\) be its vertical length.
    We are given that the horizontal length is stretched at a rate of \(3 \undiv{in}{sec},\)
    so this value is \(\textDeriv{x}{t}.\)
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{y}{t}\) when \(x = 14.\)
    The relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) is represented by the sheet's area:
    \begin{equation} 
    70 = xy \pd \label{eq:sheet-area}
    \end{equation}
    Differentiating both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:sheet-area}\) 
    with respect to time and solving for \(\textDeriv{y}{t},\) we get 
    \begin{align} 
    0 &= x \deriv{y}{t} + \deriv{x}{t} \, y \nonumber \nl 
    \deriv{y}{t} &= -\frac{y}{x} \deriv{x}{t} \pd \label{eq:sheet-dy/dt} 
    \end{align}
    When \(x = 14,\) \(\eqRefer{eq:sheet-area}\) gives \(y = 70/14 = 5.\)
    We therefore substitute these quantities and the given \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 3\)  
    in \(\eqRefer{eq:sheet-dy/dt}\) to get 
    \[\deriv{y}{t} = -\frac{5}{14} \cdot 3 = -\frac{15}{14} \pd\]
    Thus, the sheet's vertical length is <i>decreasing</i> at a rate of \(15/14\) \(\approx 1.071 \undiv{in}{sec}.\)

    The radius of a circular cone is decreasing at a rate of \(7\) inches per hour, 
    and its height is increasing at a rate of \(8\) inches per hour.
    At what rate is the cone's volume changing when its radius is \(4\) inches and its height is \(3\) inches? 
</div>
<span>
    Let \(r\) be the cone's radius and \(h\) be its height.
    The volume of the cone is then 
    \begin{equation} 
    V = \tfrac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \pd \label{eq:cone-V}
    \end{equation}
    We treat \(r\) and \(h\) as functions of time.
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{V}{t},\) the rate at which the cone's volume is changing.
    Differentiating \(\eqRefer{eq:cone-V}\) with respect to time gives 
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{V}{t} = \tfrac{1}{3} \pi \left(2r \deriv{r}{t} h + r^2 \deriv{h}{t}\right) \pd \label{eq:cone-dV/dt}

    We are given that \(\textDeriv{r}{t} = -7\) and \(\textDeriv{h}{t} = 8.\)
    When \(r = 4\) and \(h = 3,\) \(\eqRefer{eq:cone-dV/dt}\) becomes 
    \[\deriv{V}{t} = \tfrac{1}{3} \pi \left[2(4)(-7)(3) + (4)^2 (8) \right] = -40 \pi \pd\]
    Thus, the cone's volume is <i>decreasing</i> at a rate of \(40 \pi\) \(\approx 125.664 \un{in}^3/\un{hr}.\)

    A <i>meteor</i> is a piece of matter that enters Earth's atmosphere at a very high speed.
    Most meteors are small and quickly burn up, completely disintegrating before they strike the ground. 
    Suppose that a meteor of mass \(10\) grams enters Earth's atmosphere with a velocity of 
    \(40\) kilometers per second.
    This meteor loses mass at a rate of \(0.5\) gram per second 
    and decelerates at a rate of \(4\) kilometers per second per second.
    <i>Momentum</i> is the product of mass and velocity.
    (The units of momentum in this context are gram–kilometers per second.)
    Immediately after the meteor enters Earth's atmosphere, 
    what is the rate of change of its momentum? 
</div>
<span>
    Let \(p\) be the meteor's momentum. 
    Also let \(m\) and \(v\) be its mass and velocity, respectively.
    Then 
    \begin{equation} 
    p = mv \pd \label{eq:meteor-p}
    \end{equation}
    We are given that \(\textDeriv{m}{t} = -0.5 \undiv{g}{sec}.\) 
    Acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes, so \(\textDeriv{v}{t} = -4 \undiv{km}{sec}^2.\)
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{p}{t}\) immediately after the meteor enters Earth's atmosphere—that is,
    when \(m = 10 \un{g}\) and \(v = 40 \undiv{km}{sec}.\)
    To relate these rates, we differentiate both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:meteor-p}\)
    with respect to time.
    Quantities \(p,\) \(m,\) and \(v\) all vary with time, so we use the Chain Rule to differentiate:
    \begin{align} 
    \deriv{p}{t} &= \deriv{m}{t} \, v + m \deriv{v}{t} \nonumber \nl 
    &= -0.5v -4m \pd \label{eq:meteor-dp/dt}
    \end{align}
    When \(m = 10 \un{g}\) and \(v = 40 \undiv{km}{sec},\) \(\eqRefer{eq:meteor-dp/dt}\) becomes 
    \[\deriv{p}{t} = -0.5(40) - 4(10) = -60 \pd\]
    Thus, immediately when the meteor enters Earth's atmosphere, 
    its momentum is <i>decreasing</i> at a rate of \(60 \undiv{g km}{sec}^2.\)

    A balloon is inflated such that it maintains its spherical shape. 
    Air enters the balloon at a rate of \(50\) milliliters per minute.
    When the ballon's volume is \(4000 \pi/3\) milliliters, 
    find the rate at which the ballon's radius is increasing.
    (Note: \(1 \un{mL} = 1 \un{cm}^3.\))
</div>
<span>
    Let's call the balloon's radius \(r\) and its volume \(V.\)
    The problem states that the balloon's volume increases at a rate of \(50 \undiv{mL}{min},\)
    so this value is \(\textDeriv{V}{t}.\)
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{r}{t}\) when \(V = 4000 \pi/3.\)
    The relationship between \(r\) and \(V\) is 
    \begin{equation} 
    V = \tfrac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \pd \label{eq:sphere-V}
    \end{equation}
    Since \(r\) and \(V\) vary with time, we treat them as functions of time.
    Thus, we use the Chain Rule to differentiate \(\eqRefer{eq:sphere-V}\) with respect to time, \(t \col\)
    \begin{align} 
    \deriv{V}{t} &= 4 \pi r^2 \deriv{r}{t} \pd \label{eq:sphere-dV/dt}
    \end{align}
    We now need to find \(\textDeriv{V}{t}\) when \(V = 4000 \pi/3.\)
    At this instant, we find the sphere's radius using \(\eqRefer{eq:sphere-V} \col\) 
    \[\frac{4000 \pi}{3} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \implies r = 10 \pd\]
    Thus, we substitute \(r = 10\) in \(\eqRefer{eq:sphere-dV/dt};\) also recall that \(\textDeriv{V}{t} = 50.\)
    These values give 
    \[50 = 4 \pi (10)^2 \deriv{r}{t} \implies \deriv{r}{t} = \frac{1}{8 \pi} \pd\]
    We therefore conclude that, when its volume is \(4000 \pi/3 \un{mL},\) the ballon's radius is increasing at a rate 
    of \(1/(8 \pi)\) \(\approx 0.040 \undiv{cm}{min}.\)

    Two cars are approaching an intersection. Car A is driving due east at \(30\) miles per hour, 
    and car B is driving due north at \(25\) miles per hour. 
    Each car maintains its speed and direction.
    When car A is \(3\) miles west of the intersection and car B is \(4\) miles south of the intersection, 
    at what rate is the distance between the cars changing?
</div>

    Let \(x\) be the distance between car A and the intersection, 
    and let \(y\) be the distance between car B and the intersection.
    Also let \(z\) be the distance between the two cars.
    We are given that car A drives \(30\) mph due east. 
    Velocity is the rate of change of position, 
    and \(x\) is decreasing as car A approaches the intersection. 
    Thus, \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = -30 \undiv{mi}{hr}.\)
    Likewise, the problem states that car B drives \(25\) mph due north, 
    so \(\textDeriv{y}{t} = -25 \undiv{mi}{hr}\) by similar logic.
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{z}{t}\) when \(x = 3 \un{mi}\) and \(y = 4 \un{mi}.\)
    To relate \(x,\) \(y,\) and \(z\) we use the Pythagorean Theorem to obtain 
    \begin{equation} 
    z^2 = x^2 + y^2 \pd \label{eq:intersection-pythag}
    \end{equation}
    We also could write \(z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2},\) but this form is harder to differentiate. 
    We treat all three quantities as functions of time, 
    so we use the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:intersection-pythag} \col\)
    \begin{equation} 
    2z \deriv{z}{t} = 2x \deriv{x}{t} + 2y \deriv{y}{t} \pd \label{eq:intersection-pythag-diff}
    \end{equation}
    We now consider the moment we need—when \(x = 3\) and \(y = 4.\)
    We also need \(z\) at this instant; we find \(z\) from \(\eqRefer{eq:intersection-pythag}\)
    to be \(\sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5.\)
    Substituting these quantities in \(\eqRefer{eq:intersection-pythag-diff}\) gives 
    \[2(5) \deriv{z}{t} = 2(3)(-30) + 2(4)(-25) \implies \deriv{z}{t} = -38 \pd\]
    Thus, the distance between cars A and B is <i>decreasing</i>
    at a rate of \(38 \undiv{mi}{hr}.\)

    </figure>
    We call \(x\) the distance between the wall of the gingerbread house and the foot of the candy cane.
    Also let \(y\) be the height of the candy cane against the wall.
    The problem states that the candy cane slides <i>down</i> the house at \(0.1 \undiv{in}{sec},\)
    so \(\textDeriv{y}{t} = -0.1 \undiv{in}{sec}.\)
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{x}{t}\) when \(x = 3.\)
    Since the cane is sliding <i>away</i> from the house, we expect \(\textDeriv{x}{t}\) to be positive.
    To relate \(x\) and \(y,\) we use the Pythagorean Theorem:
    \begin{equation} 
    x^2 + y^2 = 5^2 \pd \label{eq:candy-cane}
    \end{equation}
    Both \(x\) and \(y\) are functions of time; 
    thus, we use the Chain Rule to differentiate \(\eqRefer{eq:candy-cane}.\)
    Doing so gives 
    \begin{align} 
    2x \deriv{x}{t} + 2y \deriv{y}{t} &= 0 \nonumber \nl 
    \deriv{x}{t} &= -\frac{y}{x} \deriv{y}{t} \pd \label{eq:candy-cane-diff}
    \end{align}
    We now plug in values:
    We're given \(\textDeriv{y}{t} = -0.1.\) 
    And when \(x = 3,\) \(y = \sqrt{5^2 - 3^2} = 4\) from \(\eqRefer{eq:candy-cane}.\)
    Putting these values in \(\eqRefer{eq:candy-cane-diff}\) gives
    \[\deriv{x}{t} = -\frac{4}{3}(-0.1) = \frac{2}{15} \pd\]
    Thus, the candy cane slides <i>away</i> from the house at a rate of \(2/15\) \(\approx 0.133 \undiv{in}{sec}.\)

    A \(15\)-foot ladder leans against a wall. 
    The ladder slides away from the wall at a rate of \(3\) feet per second. 
    When the top of the ladder is \(8\) feet above the ground, 
    determine the rate of change of the area of the triangle formed under the ladder.
</div>

    </figure>
    Let's call \(x\) the ground distance between the wall and the ladder.
    Also let \(y\) be the height of the ladder on the wall.
    The triangle formed under the ladder then has area
    \begin{equation} 
    A = \tfrac{1}{2} xy \label{eq:ladder-A}
    \end{equation}
    (see the figure). 
    The ladder slides away from the wall at a rate of \(3 \undiv{ft}{sec},\)
    so \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 3 \undiv{ft}{sec}.\)
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{A}{t}\) when \(y = 8.\)
    Differentiating \(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-A}\) with respect to time—noting 
    that \(x\) and \(y\) are functions of time—gives
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{A}{t} = \tfrac{1}{2} \left(\deriv{x}{t} y + x \deriv{y}{t} \right) \pd \label{eq:ladder-dA/dt}
    \end{equation}
    In \(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-dA/dt}\) we need the value of \(\textDeriv{y}{t}.\)
    This value isn't given, so we obtain it by forming another relationship between \(x\) 
    and \(y,\) using the Pythagorean Theorem:
    \begin{equation} 
    x^2 + y^2 = 15^2 \pd \label{eq:ladder-area-pythag}
    \end{equation}
    Differentiating \(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-area-pythag}\) gives 
    \begin{align} 
    2x \deriv{x}{t} + 2y \deriv{y}{t} &= 0 \nonumber \nl 
    \deriv{y}{t} &= -\frac{x}{y} \deriv{x}{t} \pd \label{eq:ladder-area-dy/dt}
    \end{align}
    In \(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-area-dy/dt}\) we plug in values:
    We have the given \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 3;\) and when \(y = 8,\)
    \(x = \sqrt{15^2 - 8^2}\) \(= \sqrt{161}\) [\(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-area-pythag}\)].
    We then get 
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{y}{t} = -\frac{\sqrt{161}}{8} \cdot 3 = -\frac{3\sqrt{161}}{8} \pd \label{eq:ladder-area-dy/dt-value}
    \end{equation}
    Now we have all the required values:
    We have \(y = 8,\) \(x = \sqrt{161},\) \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 3,\) and \(\textDeriv{y}{t} = -3\sqrt{161}/8\)
    [from \(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-area-dy/dt-value}\)].
    Plugging these values into \(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-dA/dt}\) gives 
    \[\deriv{A}{t} = \tfrac{1}{2} \left[3(8) + \sqrt{161} \left(-\frac{3\sqrt{161}}{8}\right) \right] = -\frac{291}{16}\pd\]
    Thus, the area of the triangle formed under the ladder is <i>decreasing</i> at a rate of 
    \(291/16\) \(\approx 18.188 \un{ft}^2 / \un{sec}.\)

    An electrical appliance of resistance \(R\) is connected to a wire that carries a current \(I.\)
    <i>Electrical power</i> is given by 
    \[P = I^2 R \pd\] 
    The appliance's resistance is increasing at a rate of \(3\) ohms per second,
    and the wire's current is increasing at a rate of \(0.1\) ampere per second.
    Find the rate at which the appliance's electrical power is changing when its resistance is \(20\) ohms
    and the wire's current is \(2\) amperes.
</div>

    Quantities \(I\) and \(R\) both vary with time, so we 
    use the Chain Rule to differentiate \(P\) with respect to time.
    We get 
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{P}{t} = 2I \deriv{I}{t} R + I^2 \deriv{R}{t} \pd \label{eq:power-diff}
    \end{equation}
    We are given that the resistance is increasing at \(3 \, \Omega/\text{sec}\) and current is increasing at \(0.1 \undiv{A}{sec}.\)
    Thus, \(\textDeriv{R}{t} = 3\) and \(\textDeriv{I}{t} = 0.1.\)
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{P}{t}\) when \(R = 20 \, \Omega\) and \(I = 2 \un{A}.\)
    Substituting these values in \(\eqRefer{eq:power-diff}\) gives 
    \[\deriv{P}{t} = 2(2)(0.1)(20) + (2)^2(3) = 20 \pd\]
    Thus, the power of the electrical appliance is increasing at a rate of \(20\) ohm–square amperes per second,
    or \(20\) <i>watts</i> per second.

    Jack is initially located \(10\) miles due west of Jorge.
    At the same moment, 
    Jorge begins to walk due south at \(3\) miles per hour, and Jack walks due west at \(4\) miles per hour. 
    After \(1\) hour, how fast is the distance between the two men changing?

    Let \(x\) be the distance Jack walks, and let \(y\) be the distance Jorge walks. 
    The horizontal distance between the two men is \(10 + x,\)
    and the vertical distance is \(y.\)
    Let \(z\) be the distance between the two men; then by the Pythagorean Theorem
    \begin{equation} 
        z^2 = (10 + x)^2 + y^2 \pd \label{eq:pythag-jack-jorge}
    \end{equation}
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{z}{t}\) after one hour.
    In \(\eqRefer{eq:pythag-jack-jorge}\) we differentiate both sides with respect to time:
    \begin{equation} 
    2z \deriv{z}{t} = 2(10 + x) \deriv{x}{t} + 2y \deriv{y}{t} \pd \label{eq:pythag-jack-jorge-diff}
    \end{equation}
    From the men's speeds, we have \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 4 \undiv{mi}{hr}\) and \(\textDeriv{y}{t} = 3 \undiv{mi}{hr}.\)
    After one hour, Jorge will have walked \(3\) miles and Jack will have walked \(4\) miles.
    And so \(x = 4\) and \(y = 3.\)
    The distance between them will be, by \(\eqRefer{eq:pythag-jack-jorge},\) 
    \(z = \sqrt{(10 + 4)^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{205}.\)
    Substituting these values in \(\eqRefer{eq:pythag-jack-jorge-diff}\) gives 
    \[2 \sqrt{205} \deriv{z}{t} = 2(10 + 4)(4) + 2(3)(3) \implies \deriv{z}{t} = \frac{65}{\sqrt{205}} \pd\]
    Therefore, the distance between Jack and Jorge is increasing at a rate of \(65/\sqrt{205}\) \(\approx 4.540 \undiv{mi}{hr}.\)

    One end of the string is then dropped to the ground

    </figure>
    Let \(x\) be the ground distance from the balcony to the end of the string.
    The string is pulled away at a rate of \(2 \undiv{ft}{sec},\) 
    so this value is \(\textDeriv{x}{t}.\)
    Let \(\ell\) be the string's length; then by the Pythagorean Theorem 
    \begin{equation} 
    \ell^2 = 10^2 + x^2 \pd \label{eq:string-length}
    \end{equation}
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{\ell}{t}\) when \(x = 8.\)
    Quantities \(\ell\) and \(x\) vary with time, so we treat them as functions of time.
    Differentiating both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:string-length}\) with respect to time 
    and solving for \(\textDeriv{\ell}{t},\) we get 
    \begin{align} 
    2 \ell \deriv{\ell}{t} &= 2x \deriv{x}{t} \nonumber \nl 
    \deriv{\ell}{t} &= \frac{x}{\ell} \deriv{x}{t} \pd \label{eq:string-length-diff}
    \end{align}
    When \(x = 8,\) \(\eqRefer{eq:string-length}\) gives \(\ell = \sqrt{10^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{164}.\)
    In \(\eqRefer{eq:string-length-diff}\) 
    we substitute the given \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 2\) along with \(x = 8\) and \(\ell = \sqrt{164},\) obtaining 
    \[\deriv{\ell}{t} = \frac{8}{\sqrt{164}}(2) = \frac{16}{\sqrt{164}} \pd\]
    Thus, when the dropped end of the string is \(8\) feet away from the balcony,
    the string's length is increasing at a rate of \(16/\sqrt{164}\) \(\approx 1.249 \undiv{ft}{sec}.\)

    Let \(x\) be the horizontal distance between the boat and the pier, 
    and let \(\ell\) be the cable's length.
    The boat is reeled <i>in</i> at a rate of \(0.1 \undiv{ft}{sec},\) so 
    \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = -0.1 \undiv{ft}{sec}.\)
    The pier is \(12\) feet above the water, so by the Pythagorean Theorem 
    \begin{equation}

    \end{equation}
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{\ell}{t}\) when \(x = 7.\)
    Since the cable is being retracted, we expect this rate to be negative. 
    Differentiating \(\eqRefer{eq:pier-pythag}\) with respect to time and solving for \(\textDeriv{\ell}{t},\)
    we get 
    \begin{align} 
    2 \ell \deriv{\ell}{t} &= 2x \deriv{x}{t} \nonumber \nl 
    \deriv{\ell}{t} &= \frac{x}{\ell} \deriv{x}{t} \pd \label{eq:pier-dl/dt}

    When \(x = 7,\) \(\eqRefer{eq:pier-pythag}\) gives \(\ell = \sqrt{7^2 + 12^2} = \sqrt{193}.\)
    Therefore, in \(\eqRefer{eq:pier-dl/dt}\) we substitute \(x = 7,\) \(\ell = \sqrt{193},\)

    \[\deriv{\ell}{t} = \frac{7}{\sqrt{193}}(-0.1) = \frac{-7}{10 \sqrt{193}} \pd\]
    Thus, when the boat is \(7 \un{ft}\) from the pier, the cable's length

    Quantities \(R_1,\) \(R_2,\) and \(R_{\text{eq}}\) all change with time,

    We are given that \(\textDeriv{R_1}{t} = 2 \, \Omega/\text{sec}\) and \(\textDeriv{R_2}{t} = 3 \, \Omega/\text{sec}.\)
    When \(R_1 = 10 \, \Omega\) and \(R_2 = 15 \, \Omega,\)
    \[R_{\text{eq}} = \par{\frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{15}}^{-1} = 6 \, \Omega \pd\]
    Thus, substituting these values in \(\eqRefer{eq:res-diff}\) gives

    When the man is \(6\) feet away from the light, find the rate at which the man's shadow length is increasing.

    Let \(s\) be the shadow length, and let \(x\) be the distance between the man and street light. 
    We are given that the man walks away from the light at \(3 \undiv{ft}{sec},\)
    so this value is \(\textDeriv{x}{t}.\)
    Let the angle between the ground and the light ray be \(\theta;\)
    then two similar right triangles are formed:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The legs of the one triangle are \(s\) and the man's height, \(5 \un{ft}.\) 
        </li>
        <li>
            The legs of the other triangle are \(s + x\) and the height of the street light, \(17 \un{ft}.\)
        </li>
    </ul>
    Both similar triangles have \(\theta\) as an angle. 
    We equate \(\tan \theta\) in both triangles: 
    \begin{equation} 
    \frac{5}{s} = \frac{17}{s + x} \pd \label{eq:shadow-man}
    \end{equation}
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{s}{t}\) when \(x = 6.\)
    We solve for \(s\) in \(\eqRefer{eq:shadow-man},\)
    obtaining \(s = 5x/12.\) 
    Both \(s\) and \(x\) are functions of time, so we differentiate to obtain 
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{s}{t} = \frac{5}{12} \deriv{x}{t} \pd \label{eq:shadow-man-diff}
    \end{equation}
    We are given \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 3,\) so \(\eqRefer{eq:shadow-man-diff}\) becomes 
    \[\deriv{s}{t} = \frac{5}{12} \cdot 3 = \frac{5}{4} \pd\]
    Thus, the man's shadow length is increasing at a rate of \(5/4\) \(= 1.25 \undiv{ft}{sec}.\)

    When the man is \(9\) feet west of the light, find the rate at which

</div>
<span>
    We call \(s\) the shadow's length and \(x\) the distance between the man and light post.
    The man jogs at a speed of \(9 \undiv{ft}{sec}\) away from the light post, so 
    \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 9 \undiv{ft}{sec}.\)
    The tip of the man's shadow has length \(L = s + x,\) 
    so we want to find \(\textDeriv{L}{t}\) when \(x = 9.\)
    We have two similar right triangles:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The legs of triangle \(1\) are \(s\) and the man's height, \(6 \un{ft}.\)
        </li>
       <li>
            The legs of triangle \(2\) are \(s + x\) and the light post's height, \(25 \un{ft}.\)
       </li>
    </ul>
    Let \(\theta\) be the angle between the ground and light ray.
    In triangle \(1,\) \(\tan \theta = 6/s;\) in triangle \(2,\) \(\tan \theta = 25/(s + x).\)
    These triangles are similar, so we have 
    \begin{equation} 
    \frac{6}{s} = \frac{25}{s + x} \pd \label{eq:shadow-jog}
    \end{equation}
    In \(\eqRefer{eq:shadow-jog}\) we get \(s = 6x/19.\)
    Differentiating this expression with respect to time then yields 
    \begin{equation*} 
    \deriv{s}{t} = \frac{6}{19} \deriv{x}{t} \pd
    \end{equation*}
    We're given that \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 9,\) so we have 
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{s}{t} = \frac{6}{19} \cdot 9 = \frac{54}{19} \pd \label{eq:shadow-jog-ds/dt}
    \end{equation}
    Differentiating \(L = s + x\) with respect to time gives 
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{L}{t} = \deriv{s}{t} + \deriv{x}{t} \pd \label{eq:shadow-jog-dL/dt}
    \end{equation}
    We have \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 9,\) and from \(\eqRefer{eq:shadow-jog-ds/dt}\) 
    \(\textDeriv{s}{t} = 54/19.\)
    So \(\eqRefer{eq:shadow-jog-dL/dt}\) is 
    \[\deriv{L}{t} = \frac{54}{19} + 9 = \frac{225}{19} \pd\]
    Thus, the tip of the man's shadow is growing at a rate of 
    \(225/19\) \(\approx 11.842 \undiv{ft}{sec}.\)

    Let \(V\) be the water's volume, \(h\) be the water level, and \(r\) be the radius of the water's circular surface.
    (These quantities are for the <i>water</i>, not the entire cone.)
    Water enters the cone at a rate of \(8 \un{ft}^3/\text{min},\) so this value is \(\textDeriv{V}{t}.\)
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{h}{t}\) when \(h = 4.\)
    We relate \(V\) to \(r\) and \(h\) as
    \begin{equation} 
    V = \tfrac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \pd \label{eq:inverted-cone-V}
    \end{equation}
    We want to express \(\eqRefer{eq:inverted-cone-V}\) in terms of solely one quantity: \(h.\)
    By similar triangles, 
    \[\frac{r}{h} = \frac{5}{10} \pd\]
    Thus, \(r = \frac{1}{2} h.\)
    Substituting this expression in \(\eqRefer{eq:inverted-cone-V}\) gives

    V = \tfrac{1}{12} \pi h^3 \pd \label{eq:inverted-cone-V-h}

    \deriv{V}{t} &= \tfrac{1}{4} \pi h^2 \deriv{h}{t} \nonumber \nl 
    \deriv{h}{t} &= \frac{4}{\pi h^2} \deriv{V}{t} \pd \label{eq:inverted-cone-dh/dt}
    \end{align}
    We now substitute \(h = 4\) and the given \(\textDeriv{V}{t} = 8\) 
    in \(\eqRefer{eq:inverted-cone-dh/dt}\) to get 
    \[\deriv{h}{t} = \frac{4}{\pi(4)^2} \cdot 8 = \frac{2}{\pi} \pd\]
    Thus, the water level is increasing at a rate of \(2/\pi\) \(\approx 0.637 \undiv{ft}{min}.\)

    In the \(xy\)-plane, let \(\theta\) be the angle subtended by the \(x\)-axis and 
    a line connecting the origin to the graph of \(y = \sqrt x.\)
    If \(x\) increases at a rate of \(3\) inches per second,
    then find the rate at which \(\theta\) changes when \(x = 4.\)
</div>
<span>
    Because \(x\) increases at \(3 \undiv{in}{sec},\) this value is \(\textDeriv{x}{t}.\)
    We relate \(\theta\) to \(x\) and \(y\) through \(\tan \theta = y/x.\)
    Since \(y = \sqrt x,\) we have 
    \begin{equation} 
    \tan \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt x} \pd \label{eq:theta-sqrt}
    \end{equation}
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{\theta}{t}\) when \(x = 4.\)
    Both \(\theta\) and \(x\) vary with time, so 
    we differentiate both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:theta-sqrt}\) with respect to time to get 
    \begin{equation} 
    \sec^2 \theta \deriv{\theta}{t} = -\tfrac{1}{2} x^{-3/2} \deriv{x}{t} \pd \label{eq:theta-sqrt-diff}
    \end{equation}
    It's easiest to express \(\eqRefer{eq:theta-sqrt-diff}\) only in terms of \(x.\)
    Since \(\sec^2 \theta = \tan^2 \theta + 1\) and \(\tan \theta = 1/\sqrt{x}\) 
    [from \(\eqRefer{eq:theta-sqrt}\)], 
    \(\eqRefer{eq:theta-sqrt-diff}\) becomes 
    \begin{align} 
    \par{\tfrac{1}{x} + 1} \deriv{\theta}{t} &= -\tfrac{1}{2} x^{-3/2} \deriv{x}{t} \nonumber \nl 
    \deriv{\theta}{t} &= \frac{1}{1 + 1/x} \par{-\tfrac{1}{2} x^{-3/2}} \deriv{x}{t} \pd \label{eq:theta-sqrt-dtheta}
    \end{align}
    We are given that \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 3,\) and we plug \(x = 4\) into \(\eqRefer{eq:theta-sqrt-dtheta}\) to find 
    \[\deriv{\theta}{t} = \frac{1}{1 + 1/4} \left(-\tfrac{1}{2}(4)^{-3/2}\right)(3) = \frac{-3}{20} \pd\]
    Thus, \(\theta\) is <i>decreasing</i> at a rate of \(3/20\) \(= 0.15 \undiv{rad}{sec}.\)
    This answer is intuitive because as \(x\) increases, \(\theta\) shrinks.

    On a flat field, Kristine extends a \(20\)-foot kite into the air. 
    A gust of wind blows the kite upward toward the sky at a rate of \(2\) feet per minute.
    Find the rate at which the ground distance between Kristine and her kite 
    is changing when the kite is \(10\) feet above the ground.
</div>
<span>
    Let \(h\) be the kite's height in the air.
    We are given that \(h\) increases at a rate of \(2 \undiv{ft}{min},\)
    so this value is \(\textDeriv{h}{t}.\)
    Let \(x\) be the ground distance between Kristine and the kite;
    we want to find \(\textDeriv{x}{t}\) when \(h = 10.\)
    We relate \(x\) and \(h\) by the Pythagorean Theorem:
    \begin{equation} 
    x^2 + h^2 = 20^2 \pd \label{eq:kite-pythag}
    \end{equation}
    Both \(x\) and \(h\) vary with time.
    We differentiate both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:kite-pythag}\) to obtain 
    \begin{align} 
    2x \deriv{x}{t} + 2h \deriv{h}{t} &= 0 \nonumber \nl 
    \deriv{x}{t} &= \frac{-h}{x} \deriv{h}{t} \pd \label{eq:kite-diff} 
    \end{align}
    When \(h = 10,\) \(\eqRefer{eq:kite-pythag}\) gives 
    \(x = \sqrt{20^2 - 10^2} = \sqrt{300}.\)
    In \(\eqRefer{eq:kite-diff}\) we substitute the given \(\textDeriv{h}{t} = 2\)
    along with \(h = 10\) and \(x = \sqrt{300} \col\)
    \[\deriv{x}{t} = \frac{-10}{\sqrt{300}} \cdot 2 = \frac{-2}{\sqrt 3} \pd\]
    Thus, the ground distance between Kristine and her kite is <i>decreasing</i> 
    at a rate of \(2/\sqrt 3\) \(\approx 1.155 \undiv{ft}{min}.\)

    A hot air balloon rises at a rate of \(3\) feet per second over a flat terrain.
    A house is \(100\) feet away from the balloon's shadow directly below.
    When the balloon is \(200\) feet above the ground,
    find the rate at which the angle of elevation from the house to the balloon is changing.
</div>
<span>
    The ground distance between the house and the hot air balloon is a constant \(100 \un{ft}.\)
    Let \(y\) be the height of the balloon above the ground.
    Let \(\theta\) be the angle of elevation, subtended by the ground 
    and a line connecting the house to the balloon. 
    Quantities \(\theta\) and \(y\) both vary with time. 
    Because the hot air balloon rises at a rate of \(3 \undiv{ft}{sec},\)
    this value is \(\textDeriv{y}{t}.\)
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{\theta}{t}\) when \(y = 200.\)
    The relationship between \(\theta\) and \(y\) is 
    \begin{equation} 
    \tan \theta = \frac{y}{100} \pd \label{eq:balloon-angle}
    \end{equation}
    We differentiate both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:balloon-angle}\) with respect to time, finding 
    \begin{equation} 
    \sec^2 \theta \deriv{\theta}{t} = \tfrac{1}{100} \deriv{y}{t} \pd \label{eq:balloon-angle-diff}
    \end{equation}
    It is simpler to continue using only \(y.\) 
    Because \(\sec^2 \theta = \tan^2 \theta + 1\) and \(\tan \theta = y/100\) [see \(\eqRefer{eq:balloon-angle}\)],
    \(\eqRefer{eq:balloon-angle-diff}\) becomes 
    \begin{align} 
    \left[\par{\tfrac{y}{100}}^2 + 1\right] \deriv{\theta}{t} &= \tfrac{1}{100} \deriv{y}{t} \nonumber \nl 
    \deriv{\theta}{t} &= \frac{1}{(y/100)^2 + 1} \par{\tfrac{1}{100} \deriv{y}{t}} \pd \label{eq:balloon-angle-dtheta/dt}
    \end{align}
    In \(\eqRefer{eq:balloon-angle-dtheta/dt}\) we substitute \(\textDeriv{y}{t} = 3\) and \(y = 200\) to get 
    \[\deriv{\theta}{t} = \frac{1}{(200/100)^2 + 1} \par{\tfrac{1}{100} \cdot 3} = \frac{3}{500} \pd\]
    The angle of elevation therefore is increasing at a rate of \(3/500\) \(= 0.006 \undiv{rad}{sec}.\)

    A boat leaks \(300\) cubic inches of oil into a pond. 
    The oil spill spreads over the surface of the pond in the shape of a cylinder with uniform depth.
    The radius of the cylinder steadily increases at a rate of \(4\) inches per second.
    When the cylinder's radius is \(6\) inches,
    find the rate at which the cylinder's thickness is changing. 
</div>
<span>
    Let \(r\) be the cylinder's radius and \(h\) be its thickness. 
    The volume of the cylinder remains a constant \(300 \un{in}^3,\) 
    so we have 
    \begin{equation} 
    \pi r^2 h = 300 \pd \label{eq:cylinder-V}
    \end{equation}
    Quantities \(r\) and \(h\) vary with time, so we treat them as functions of time.
    We are given that the radius of the cylinder increases at a rate of \(4 \undiv{in}{sec},\)
    so this value is \(\textDeriv{r}{t}.\)
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{h}{t}\) when \(r = 6 \un{in}.\)
    We differentiate both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:cylinder-V}\) with respect to time, obtaining 
    \begin{align} 
    \pi \left[2r \deriv{r}{t} h + r^2 \deriv{h}{t} \right] &= 0 \nonumber \nl
    \deriv{h}{t} &= \frac{-2h}{r} \deriv{r}{t} \pd \label{eq:cylinder-V-diff}
    \end{align}
    When \(r = 6,\) \(\eqRefer{eq:cylinder-V}\) gives \(h = 300/(36 \pi) = 25/(3 \pi).\)
    Also, \(\textDeriv{r}{t} = 4\) is given. 
    Substituting these values in \(\eqRefer{eq:cylinder-V-diff}\) yields 
    \[\deriv{h}{t} = \par{\frac{-2}{6}} \par{\frac{25}{3 \pi}} (4) = \frac{-100}{9 \pi} \pd\]
    Thus, the cylinder's thickness is <i>decreasing</i> at a rate of \(100/(9 \pi)\) 
    \(\approx 3.537 \undiv{in}{sec}.\)

    A clock's minute hand has length \(\ell\) inches.
    In terms of \(\ell,\) find the rate at which the hand sweeps out area
    in terms of square inches per minute.
</div>
<span>
    Suppose that the clock begins ticking at some time—say, 
    \(12\) o'clock. 
    Let \(\theta\) be the angle the minute hand sweeps out after this time;
    in other words, \(\theta\) is the angle between the vertical and the minute hand.
    The area of the sector intercepted by \(\theta\) is then 
    \begin{equation} 
    A = \tfrac{1}{2} \theta \, \ell^2 \pd \label{eq:clock-A}
    \end{equation}
    Only \(A\) and \(\theta\) vary with time; \(\ell\) is a constant length.
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{A}{t}.\)
    Differentiating both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:clock-A}\) with respect to time, we obtain 
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{A}{t} = \tfrac{1}{2} \ell^2 \deriv{\theta}{t} \pd \label{eq:clock-dA/dt}
    \end{equation}
    Since the problem needs \(\textDeriv{A}{t}\) to be in terms of square inches per minute,
    \(t\) needs to be in minutes.
    We therefore need \(\textDeriv{\theta}{t}\) to be in terms of radians per minute,
    because radians are a dimensionless quantity that enable the units 
    on both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:clock-dA/dt}\) to align with each other.
    We make the following remarks:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The minute hand makes one revolution around the clock in one hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are \(60\) minutes in one hour.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are \(2 \pi\) radians in one revolution.
        </li>
    </ul>
    For clarity we use dimensional analysis, beginning with the first remark, to convert
    revolutions per hour to radians per minute:
    \[\frac{1 {\color{green} \cancel{\un{rev}}}}{1 {\color{orange} \cancel{\un{hr}}}} \times 
    \frac{1 {\color{orange} \cancel{\un{hr}}}}{60 \un{min}} \times \frac{2 \pi \un{rad}}{1 {\color{green} \cancel{\un{rev}}}}
    = \frac{\pi \un{rad}}{30 \un{min}} \pd\]
    Thus, \(\textDeriv{\theta}{t} = \frac{\pi}{30} \undiv{rad}{min}.\)
    \(\eqRefer{eq:clock-dA/dt}\) then becomes 
    \[\deriv{A}{t} = \tfrac{1}{2} \ell^2 \par{\frac{\pi}{30}} = \boxed{\frac{\pi}{60} \ell^2}\]

    When a \(10\)-foot ladder slides down a wall at a rate of \(0.6\) foot per second, 
    the angle \(\theta\) between the floor and the ladder is changing.
    Find the rate at which \(\theta\) is changing when the bottom of the ladder is \(6\) feet away from the wall.
</div>
<span>
    <figure class="related-rates-ladder-angle" id="related-rates-ladder-angle">
        <img src="../images/sectionImages/related-rates-ladder-angle.jpg" alt="related-rates-ladder-angle.jpg">
    </figure>
    We assign \(x\) to be the distance between the wall and the ladder's foot.
    Also let \(y\) be the height of the ladder on the wall.
    The ladder slides down the wall at a rate of \(0.6 \undiv{ft}{sec},\)
    so \(\textDeriv{y}{t} = -0.6 \undiv{ft}{sec}.\)
    The angle \(\theta\) is formed between the floor and the ladder, as shown in the figure. 
    We want \(\textDeriv{\theta}{t}\) when \(x = 6.\)
    The relationship between \(\theta\) and the two lengths \(x\) and \(y\) is 
    \begin{equation} 
    \tan \theta = \frac{y}{x} \pd \label{eq:ladder-angle}
    \end{equation}
    In \(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-angle}\) \(x\) and \(y\) are functions of time.
    Therefore, we use the Chain Rule in differentiating both sides with respect to time:
    \begin{equation} 
    \sec^2 \theta \deriv{\theta}{t} = \frac{\deriv{y}{t} \, x - y \deriv{x}{t}}{x^2} \pd \label{eq:ladder-angle-diff} 
    \end{equation}
    We want to express \(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-angle-diff}\) in terms of solely \(x\) and \(y.\)
    Since \(\sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta\) and \(\tan \theta = y/x\) [from \(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-angle}\)],
    \(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-angle-diff}\) becomes 
    \begin{equation} 
    \par{1 + \frac{y^2}{x^2}} \deriv{\theta}{t} = \frac{\deriv{y}{t} \, x - y \deriv{x}{t}}{x^2} \pd \label{eq:ladder-angle-diff-x-y}
    \end{equation}
    The value of \(\textDeriv{x}{t}\) isn't given. 
    We find it by constructing another relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) using the Pythagorean Theorem:
    \begin{equation} 
    x^2 + y^2 = 10^2 \pd \label{eq:ladder-angle-pythag}
    \end{equation}
    Differentiating \(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-angle-pythag}\) and solving for \(\textDeriv{x}{t}\) give 
    \begin{align} 
    2x \deriv{x}{t} + 2y \deriv{y}{t} &= 0 \nonumber \nl 
    \deriv{x}{t} &= -\frac{y}{x} \deriv{y}{t} \pd \label{eq:ladder-angle-dx/dt}
    \end{align}
    When \(x = 6,\) \(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-angle-pythag}\) gives \(y = \sqrt{10^2 - 6^2} = 8\) 
    and so \(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-angle-dx/dt}\) becomes 
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{x}{t} = -\frac{8}{6}(-0.6) = 0.8 \pd
    \end{equation}
    Thus, for \(x = 6\) and \(y = 8\) \(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-angle-diff-x-y}\) becomes 
    \[\deriv{\theta}{t} = \frac{1}{1 + (8/6)^2} \, \frac{-0.6(6) - 8(0.8)}{6^2} = \frac{-1}{10} \pd\]
    We therefore conclude that \(\theta\) is <i>decreasing</i> at a rate of \(\tfrac{1}{10} \undiv{rad}{sec}.\)
    This answer is physically intuitive because the angle between the floor and ladder shrinks as the ladder 
    slides across the floor.

    The figure shows a top-down view of the parking lot. 
    Let \(x\) be the distance east of parking space \(\text{B}1.\)
    When the camera pans around, it faces a specific point—labeled in the figure as "X."
    The angle the camera has rotated is \(\theta.\)
    The speed at which the camera sweeps out the region "X" is \(\textDeriv{x}{t}.\)
    We therefore want to find \(\textDeriv{x}{t}\) when \(x = 20.\)
    The camera rotates at a speed of \(10 \undiv{rev}{min},\) which we convert to radians per minute
    because radians are a dimensionless quantity. 
    We have 
    \[\frac{10 \cancel{\un{rev}}}{1 \un{min}} \times \frac{2 \pi \un{rad}}{1 \cancel{\un{rev}}} = \frac{20 \pi \un{rad}}{1 \un{min}} \pd
    \]
    Thus, \(\textDeriv{\theta}{t} = 20 \pi \undiv{rad}{min}.\)
    We relate \(x\) and \(\theta\) through 
    \begin{equation} 
    \tan \theta = \frac{x}{40} \pd \label{eq:camera}
    \end{equation}
    Differentiating both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:camera}\) with respect to time, we get

    \sec^2 \theta \deriv{\theta}{t} = \tfrac{1}{40} \deriv{x}{t} \pd \label{eq:camera-diff}
    \end{equation}
    We want to express all quantities in terms of \(x.\)
    Using the identity \(\sec^2 \theta = \tan^2 \theta + 1\) and \(\tan \theta = x/40\) [\(\eqRefer{eq:camera}\)],
    from \(\eqRefer{eq:camera-diff}\) we get  
    \begin{align} 
    \left[\par{\tfrac{x}{40}}^2 + 1\right] \deriv{\theta}{t} &= \tfrac{1}{40} \deriv{x}{t} \nonumber \nl 
    \deriv{x}{t} &= 40 \left[\par{\tfrac{x}{40}}^2 + 1\right] \deriv{\theta}{t} \pd \label{eq:camera-diff-dx/dt}
    \end{align}
    In \(\eqRefer{eq:camera-diff-dx/dt}\) we plug in \(\textDeriv{\theta}{t} = 20 \pi\) and \(x = 20 \col\)
    \[\deriv{x}{t} = 40 \left[\par{\tfrac{20}{40}}^2 + 1 \right] \cdot 20 \pi = 1000 \pi \pd\]
    Thus, the camera sweeps the area \(20\) feet east of parking space \(\text{B}1\) at a speed of \(1000 \pi\)
    \(\approx 3141.593 \undiv{ft}{min}.\)

    The figure shows a top-down view of the situation. 
    The point nearest the lighthouse is \(P,\) \(5 \un{mi}\) to the south.
    When the lighthouse's beacon spins, light faces a certain spot on the shoreline—point \(Q,\) a distance \(x\) miles
    away from \(P.\)
    Let \(\theta\) be the angle shown in the figure.
    The beacon revolves at \(2 \undiv{rev}{sec};\) in radians per second this rate is 
    \[\frac{2 \cancel{\un{rev}}}{1 \un{sec}} \times \frac{2 \pi \un{rad}}{1 \cancel{\un{rev}}} = \frac{4 \pi \un{rad}}{1 \un{sec}} \pd
    \]
    Thus, \(\textDeriv{\theta}{t} = 4 \pi \undiv{rad}{sec}.\)
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{x}{t}\) when \(x = 3.\)
    Quantities \(x\) and \(\theta\) are related by 
    \begin{equation} 
    \tan \theta = \frac{x}{5} \pd \label{eq:lighthouse-theta}

    \[\left[\par{\tfrac{x}{5}}^2 + 1\right] \deriv{\theta}{t} = \tfrac{1}{5} \deriv{x}{t} \pd\]
    Solving for \(\textDeriv{x}{t},\) and substituting \(x = 3\) and \(\textDeriv{\theta}{t} = 4 \pi,\)
    we have 
    \[\deriv{x}{t} = 5 \left[\par{\tfrac{3}{5}}^2 + 1\right] \cdot 4 \pi = \frac{136 \pi}{5} \pd\]
    Thus, the light's speed is \(136 \pi/5\) \(\approx 85.451 \undiv{mi}{sec}\)
    on the shoreline \(3 \un{mi}\) away from the nearest point to the lighthouse.

    A baseball player begins to run from second base to third base at a speed of \(20\) feet per second.
    After three seconds of running, find the rate at which the distance between the player and home plate is changing.

    Let \(x\) be the distance the player runs.
    Since the player runs at a speed of \(20 \undiv{ft}{sec},\)
    this value is \(\textDeriv{x}{t}.\)
    After three seconds, the player will have run \(60 \un{ft}.\)
    Let \(z\) be the distance between the player and home base. 
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{z}{t}\) when \(x = 60 \un{ft}.\)
    Quantities \(x\) and \(z\) are related by 
    \begin{equation} 
    (90 - x)^2 + 90^2 = z^2 \pd \label{eq:baseball-pythag}
    \end{equation}
    We differentiate both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:baseball-pythag}\) with respect to time, obtaining 
    \begin{align} 
    -2(90 - x) \deriv{x}{t} &= 2z \deriv{z}{t} \nonumber \nl
    \deriv{z}{t} &= \frac{x - 90}{z} \deriv{x}{t} \pd \label{eq:baseball-dz/dt} 
    \end{align}
    When \(x = 60,\) \(\eqRefer{eq:baseball-pythag}\) gives 
    \[z = \sqrt{(90 - 60)^2 + 90^2} = \sqrt{9000} = 30 \sqrt{10} \pd\]
    Substituting this value, along with \(x = 60\) and \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 20,\) in \(\eqRefer{eq:baseball-dz/dt}\) gives 
    \[\deriv{z}{t} = \frac{60 - 90}{30 \sqrt{10}} \cdot 20 = -2 \sqrt{10} \pd \]
    Thus, the distance between the player and home base is <i>decreasing</i>
    at a rate of \(2 \sqrt{10}\) \(\approx 6.325 \undiv{ft}{sec}.\)

    A batter hits a baseball from home plate straight to second base at a speed of \(122\) feet per second.
    After \(0.5\) second, how quickly is the distance between the baseball and first base changing? 
    (See <a href="#related-rates-baseball-field">Figure 2</a>.)
</div>
<span>
    <figure class="related-rates-baseball-home2" id="related-rates-baseball-home2">

    Let \(x\) be the distance the baseball travels. 
    Let \(z\) be the distance between the baseball and first base.
    Since the ball travels at \(122 \undiv{ft}{sec},\) this value is \(\textDeriv{x}{t}.\)
    After \(0.5 \un{sec}\) the ball will have traveled \(x = 61 \un{ft}.\)
    We want to find \(\textDeriv{z}{t}\) when \(x = 61 \un{ft}.\)  
    Note that the angle between the baseball's path and the path from home base to first base is 
    \(45 \degree.\)
    By the Law of Cosines, 
    \[z^2 = x^2 + 90^2 - 2(x)(90) \cos 45 \degree \cma\]
    or 
    \begin{equation} 
    z^2 = x^2 + 90^2 - 90 \sqrt 2 \, x \pd \label{eq:baseball-cos}
    \end{equation}
    We differentiate both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:baseball-cos}\) to get 
    \begin{align} 
    2z \deriv{z}{t} &= 2x \deriv{x}{t} - 90 \sqrt 2 \deriv{x}{t} \nonumber \nl 
    \deriv{z}{t} &= \frac{x - 45 \sqrt 2}{z} \deriv{x}{t} \pd \label{eq:baseball-cos-dz/dt}
    \end{align}
    When \(x = 61,\) \(\eqRefer{eq:baseball-cos}\) gives 
    \[z = \sqrt{61^2 + 90^2 - 90(61) \sqrt 2} \pd\]
    Substituting this value, as well as \(x = 61\) and \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 122,\) 
    in \(\eqRefer{eq:baseball-cos-dz/dt}\) gives 
    \[\deriv{z}{t} = \frac{61 - 45 \sqrt 2}{\sqrt{61^2 + 90^2 - 90(61) \sqrt 2}} \cdot 122 \approx -5.056 \pd \]
    Thus, the distance between the baseball and first base is <i>decreasing</i>
    at a rate of \(5.056 \undiv{ft}{sec}.\)
