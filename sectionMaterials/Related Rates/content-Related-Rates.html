    When you inflate a basketball, both its volume and radius are expanding; 
    the rates at which the radius and volume increase are <i>related rates</i>.
    In this section, we manage multiple related rates. 
    You'll learn to determine the rate at which the basketball's radius is increasing 
    when given another rate—the rate at which the basketball's volume expands.
    This topic applies the Chain Rule, which we discussed in Section <!--[[[cref.Chain-Rule]]]-->,
    to physical phenomena.
</p>
<p>
    In <span class="emph">related rates</span> problems, 
    one or more quantities are changing with respect to time.
    When given a problem, it is important to read carefully, draw a diagram, and assign symbols. 
    The objective is to write an equation that relates changing quantities,
    and then differentiate with respect to time. 
    We use the Chain Rule because we treat each quantity—for example, 
    height, volume, length—as a function of time.
    For example, suppose \(x\) and \(Q\) are physical quantities in \(Q(x) = x^2 + 4x,\) and \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 3.\)
    We use the Chain Rule to calculate \(\textDeriv{Q}{t} \col\)
    \[
    \ba 
    \deriv{Q}{t} &= \deriv{Q}{x} \deriv{x}{t} \nl 
    &= (2x + 4)(3) = 6x + 12 \pd 
    \ea 
    \]
    The rate \(Q'(2) = 24\) represents how quickly \(Q\) is changing when \(x = 2.\)

    Since we treat physical quantities as functions of time, \(t,\) we may write a physical quantity \(Q\) 
    as \(Q(t).\)
    For example, we can denote a height that changes with time either as \(h\) or \(h(t);\)
    the difference is purely notational, and the latter form is implied.

    <p>
        To understand the problem, we construct a sketch (<a href="#related-rates-tank">Figure 1</a>).
        Let \(V\) be the water's volume and \(h\) be the water's height.
        Note that these quantities represent the <i>water</i>, not the entire tank.
        Quantities \(h\) and \(V\) vary with time, so we treat them as functions of time.
        Derivatives represent the rate of change of a quantity:
        The water's volume is increasing at a rate of \(30\) cubic inches per second,
        so \(\textDeriv{V}{t} = 30 \un{in}^3/\text{sec}.\)
        We want to find \(\textDeriv{h}{t},\) the rate at which the water's height is increasing.
    </p>
    <p>
        We need to construct a relationship between \(h\) and \(V.\) 
        The volume of a cylinder of radius \(r\) and height \(h\) is \(V = \pi r^2 h.\)
        Here \(r = 10,\) so the water's volume is 
        \begin{equation} 
        V = 100 \pi h \pd \label{eq:tank-V}
        \end{equation}
        We use the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:tank-V}\) with respect to time, \(t.\)
        Differentiating and solving for \(\textDeriv{h}{t},\) we get 
        \begin{align} 
        \deriv{V}{t} &= 100 \pi \deriv{h}{t} \nonumber \nl 
        \deriv{h}{t} &= \frac{1}{100 \pi} \deriv{V}{t} \pd \label{eq:tank-dh/dt}
        \end{align}
        Since \(\textDeriv{V}{t} = 30 \un{in}^3/\text{sec},\) \(\eqRefer{eq:tank-dh/dt}\) becomes  
        \[\deriv{h}{t} = \frac{1}{100 \pi}(30) = \frac{3}{10 \pi} \pd\]
        Thus, the water level is increasing at a rate of \(3 /(10 \pi)\) \(\approx 0.095 \undiv{in}{sec}.\)  
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    <a href="#ex-tank">Example 1</a> shows a situation in which the rates are constant.
    In other words, \(\textDeriv{h}{t}\) does not depend on \(h,\)
    the depth of the water.
    But in other problems, rates are not constant: 
    Sometimes we must evaluate a derivative at a given point.
    In these cases, we must plug in the point <i>after</i> computing the derivative.
</p>
<p>
    It is best practice to plug in numbers as the <i>final</i> step.
    In other words, after differentiating you should immediately solve for the quantity you need, before substituting values.
    This practice reduces the risk of committing arithmetic errors.

    <p>
        We begin by constructing a sketch (<a href="#related-rates-snowball">Figure 2</a>).
        We call \(r\) the snowball's radius and \(V\) the snowball's volume.
        We treat these quantities as functions of time.
        Since the volume is shrinking at \(15 \un{in}^3/\un{sec},\) 
        \(\textDeriv{V}{t} = -15 \un{in}^3/\un{sec}.\)
        The snowball's radius is also decreasing, so we expect \(\textDeriv{r}{t}\) to be negative. 
        We want \(\textDeriv{r}{t}\) when \(r = 10 \un{in}.\)
    </p>
    <p>
        To relate \(V\) and \(r,\) a sphere of radius \(r\) has volume 
        \begin{equation} 
        V = \tfrac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \pd \label{eq:snowball-V}
        \end{equation}
        In \(\eqRefer{eq:snowball-V}\) we differentiate both sides with respect to time by using the Chain Rule.
        Doing so and solving for \(\textDeriv{r}{t}\) yield
        \begin{align} 
        \deriv{V}{t} &= 4 \pi r^2 \deriv{r}{t} \nonumber \nl 
        \deriv{r}{t} &= \frac{1}{4 \pi r^2} \deriv{V}{t} \pd \label{eq:snowball-dV/dt}
        \end{align}
        <aside class="box-remark">
            In \(\eqRefer{eq:snowball-V}\) we <i>first</i> differentiate \(V\) <i>before</i> substituting \(r = 10 \un{in}.\)
            The other way around modifies function \(V(t)\) such that \(\textDeriv{V}{t} = 0,\) a nonsensical result.
        </aside>
        In \(\eqRefer{eq:snowball-dV/dt},\) we substitute \(r = 10 \un{in}\)
        and the given \(\textDeriv{V}{t} = -15 \un{in}^3/\un{sec}\) to find 
        \[
        \deriv{r}{t} = \frac{1}{4 \pi(10)^2}(-15) = \frac{-3}{80 \pi} \pd 
        \]
        Therefore, when the snowball's radius is \(10 \un{in},\)
        its radius is <i>decreasing</i> at a rate of \(3/(80 \pi) \approx 0.012 \undiv{in}{sec}.\)

    <p>
        In <a href="#related-rates-ladder">Figure 3</a>
        we let \(x\) be the distance between the wall and the bottom of the ladder, 
        and we let \(y\) be the distance between the floor and the top of the ladder. 
        Length \(x\) increases at a rate of \(2 \undiv{ft}{sec},\) so \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 2 \undiv{ft}{sec}.\) 
        We want to find the rate at which \(y\) changes—that is, \(\textDeriv{y}{t}\)—when \(x = 7 \un{ft}.\)
        We expect this rate to be negative because \(y\) is decreasing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lengths \(x\) and \(y\) form a right triangle of hypotenuse \(20 \un{ft}.\)
        Thus, by the Pythagorean Theorem 
        \begin{equation} 
        x^2 + y^2 = 20^2 \pd \label{eq:ladder-xy}
        \end{equation}
        Differentiating both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-xy}\) with respect to time 
        and solving for \(\textDeriv{y}{t},\) we obtain 
        \begin{align} 
        2x \deriv{x}{t} + 2y \deriv{y}{t} &= 0 \nonumber \nl 
        \deriv{y}{t} &= -\frac{x}{y} \deriv{x}{t} \pd \label{eq:ladder-diff}
        \end{align}
        <aside class="box-remark">
            Instead of \(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-xy},\) we also could have written the relationship 
            \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 20.\)
            But this form is harder to differentiate. 
        </aside>
        We want to solve for \(\textDeriv{y}{t}\) when \(x = 7 \un{ft};\)
        at this instant \(y = \sqrt{20^2 - 7^2} = \sqrt{351} \un{ft}\) by \(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-xy}.\)
        Substituting these values, along with \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = 2 \undiv{ft}{sec},\) 
        in \(\eqRefer{eq:ladder-diff}\) then gives 
        \[
        \ba 
        \deriv{y}{t} &= -\frac{7}{\sqrt{351}}(2) = \frac{-14}{\sqrt{351}} \pd
        \ea 
        \]
        Therefore, when the ladder's foot is \(7 \un{ft}\) away from the wall, 
        the top of the ladder slides <i>down</i> the wall at a rate of 
        \(14/\sqrt{351}\) \(\approx 0.747 \undiv{ft}{sec}.\)

<p>
    When problems involve right triangles, we want to differentiate the simplest possible form. 
    For example, in <a href="#ex-ladder">Example 3</a> we chose to write the Pythagorean Theorem as 
    \(x^2 + y^2 = 20^2\) instead of \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 20.\)
    Moreover, if the problem involves <i>multiple</i> right triangles, 
    we want to form a relationship between their lengths by similar triangles.
    Therefore, it is a good idea to label angles because it's easier to spot similar triangles.
    The following examples demonstrate these points.

        <i>Shadow Length.</i> In <a href="#related-rates-shadow">Figure 4</a> 
        the angle between the ground and light ray is \(\theta.\)
        We find two similar right triangles:

                The legs of triangle 1 are \(s\) and the man's height, \(6 \un{ft}.\)

        In triangle 1, \(\tan \theta = 6/s;\) in triangle 2, \(\tan \theta = 20/(s + x).\)
        These trigonometric ratios are equivalent, so we have

        \frac{6}{s} = \frac{20}{s + x} \pd

        Solving for \(s\) gives \(s = 3x/7.\)
        Differentiating both sides with respect to time then yields

        \deriv{s}{t} = \tfrac{3}{7} \deriv{x}{t} \pd \label{eq:shadow-ds/dt}

        In <a href="#related-rates-cone">Figure 5</a>
        we let \(h\) be the water level and \(r\) be the radius of the water's circular surface.
        Note that these quantities model the <i>water</i>, not the entire tank.
        The volume of the water is then  
        \begin{equation} 
        V = \tfrac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \pd \label{eq:cone-water-volume}
        \end{equation}
        Water flows into the tank at a rate of \(5 \un{ft}^3/\un{sec},\)
        so this value is \(\textDeriv{V}{t}.\) 
        The objective is to find \(\textDeriv{h}{t}\) when \(h = 2 \un{ft},\)
        and we expect this rate to be positive because the water level increases as water flows in.
        Our goal is to express \(\eqRefer{eq:cone-water-volume}\) in terms of solely \(h,\)
        and then differentiate both sides to relate \(\textDeriv{V}{t}\) and \(\textDeriv{h}{t}.\)
        We therefore need to express \(r\) in terms of \(h.\)
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the entire tank has radius \(2 \un{ft}\) and height \(6 \un{ft},\) 
        we construct a relationship using similar triangles:
        \[
        \frac{2}{6} = \frac{r}{h} \pd

        Then \(r = \frac{2}{6}h\) \(= \frac{1}{3}h,\) which we substitute in \(\eqRefer{eq:cone-water-volume}\) to get 
        \[V = \tfrac{1}{3} \pi \par{\tfrac{1}{3}h}^2 h = \tfrac{1}{27} \pi h^3 \pd\]
        Differentiating both sides with respect to time and solving for \(\textDeriv{h}{t},\) 
        we attain
        \begin{align} 
        \deriv{V}{t} &= \tfrac{1}{9} \pi h^2 \deriv{h}{t} \nonumber \nl 
        \deriv{h}{t} &= \frac{9}{\pi h^2} \deriv{V}{t} \pd \label{eq:cone-dh/dt}
        \end{align}
        In \(\eqRefer{eq:cone-dh/dt}\) we substitute \(h = 2 \un{ft}\) and the given \(\textDeriv{V}{t} = 5 \un{ft}^3/\un{sec} \col\)
        \[
        \deriv{h}{t} = \frac{9}{\pi (2)^2}(5) = \frac{45}{4 \pi} \pd
        \]
        Thus, the water level is increasing at a rate of \(45/(4 \pi)\) \(\approx 3.581 \undiv{ft}{sec}\)
        when the water is \(2 \un{ft}\) deep.

        In <a href="#related-rates-car">Figure 6</a> let \(x\) be the distance between car A and the intersection,
        and let \(y\) be the distance between car B and the intersection.
        Also let \(z\) be the distance between cars A and B.
        Distance \(x\) is <i>decreasing</i>
        at a rate of \(30 \undiv{mi}{hr};\) thus, \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = -30 \undiv{mi}{hr}.\)
        Likewise, distance \(y\) is <i>decreasing</i> at a rate of \(45 \undiv{mi}{hr},\)
        so \(\textDeriv{y}{t} = -45 \undiv{mi}{hr}.\)
        We want to find \(\textDeriv{z}{t}\) when \(x = 6 \un{mi}\) and \(y = 8 \un{mi},\)
        and we expect this rate to be <i>negative</i> because the two cars 
        are moving closer to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        To relate \(x,\) \(y,\) and \(z\) we use the Pythagorean Theorem:
        \begin{equation} 
        z^2 = x^2 + y^2 \pd \label{eq:cars-pythag}
        \end{equation}
        All three quantities vary with time, so we need the Chain Rule to differentiate \(\eqRefer{eq:cars-pythag}\)
        with respect to time.
        Differentiating and solving for \(\textDeriv{z}{t}\) produce
        \begin{align} 
        2z \deriv{z}{t} &= 2x \deriv{x}{t} + 2y \deriv{y}{t} \nonumber \nl 
        \deriv{z}{t} &= \tfrac{1}{z} \left[2x \deriv{x}{t} + 2y \deriv{y}{t}\right] \pd \label{eq:cars-pythag-diff}
        \end{align}
    </p>
    <aside class="box-remark">
        In \(\eqRefer{eq:cars-pythag}\) it's also correct to write
        \(z = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2},\) but this equation is harder to differentiate.
        We generally seek the <i>simplest</i> possible form to differentiate.
    </aside>
    <p>
        Now we substitute: When \(x = 6 \un{mi}\) and \(y = 8 \un{mi},\)
        \(\eqRefer{eq:cars-pythag}\) gives \(z = \sqrt{6^2 + 8^2} = 10 \un{mi}.\)
        Substituting these quantities, along with \(\textDeriv{x}{t} = -30 \undiv{mi}{hr}\) 
        and \(\textDeriv{y}{t} = -45 \undiv{mi}{hr},\) in \(\eqRefer{eq:cars-pythag-diff}\) gives 
        \[\deriv{z}{t} = \tfrac{1}{10} \left[2(6)(-30) + 2(8)(-45) \right] = -108 \pd\]
        Thus, the distance between cars A and B is <i>decreasing</i> 
        at a rate of \(108 \undiv{mi}{hr}\) when car A is \(6 \un{mi}\) west of the intersection 
        and car B is \(8 \un{mi}\) south of the intersection.

        A cable connects a hot air balloon to a fixed pivot point on the ground \(50\) meters away.
        The hot air balloon then ascends straight upward at a speed of \(6\) meters per second.
        When the balloon is \(40\) meters above the ground, 
        find the rate of change of the angle of elevation from the pivot point to the ballon.

    <p>
        Drawing a sketch (<a href="#related-rates-balloon">Figure 7</a>),
        we let \(h\) be the balloon's altitude. 
        Angle \(\theta\) is formed between the cable and ground,
        and the pivot point is a fixed \(50 \un{m}\) away from the balloon's ground shadow.
        The balloon ascends at a speed of \(6 \undiv{m}{sec},\)
        so this rate is \(\textDeriv{h}{t}.\)
        We want to find \(\textDeriv{\theta}{t}\) when \(h = 40 \un{m};\)
        this rate should be positive because the angle of elevation is extending 
        as the balloon rises. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We relate \(\theta\) to \(h\) using 
        \begin{equation} 
        \tan \theta = \tfrac{h}{50} \pd \label{eq:balloon-tan-theta}
        \end{equation}
        Differentiating both sides of \(\eqRefer{eq:balloon-tan-theta}\) with respect to time, 
        we obtain 
        \begin{equation}    
        \sec^2 \theta \deriv{\theta}{t} = \tfrac{1}{50} \deriv{h}{t} \pd \label{eq:balloon-diff}
        \end{equation}
        For simplicity we express \(\eqref{eq:balloon-diff}\) solely in terms of \(h \col \)
        Since \(\sec^2 \theta = \tan^2 \theta + 1\) and \(\tan \theta = h/50\) [\(\eqref{eq:balloon-tan-theta}\)],
        \(\eqref{eq:balloon-diff}\) becomes 
        \begin{align} 
        \left[\left(\tfrac{h}{50}\right)^2 + 1\right] \deriv{\theta}{t} &= \tfrac{1}{50} \deriv{h}{t} \nonumber \nl 
        \deriv{\theta}{t} &= \frac{1}{(h/50)^2 + 1} \left(\tfrac{1}{50} \deriv{h}{t}\right) \pd \label{eq:balloon-dtheta/dt}
        \end{align}
        <aside class="box-remark">
            In \(\eqRefer{eq:balloon-dtheta/dt}\) it is also correct to write 
            \[\deriv{\theta}{t} = \cos^2 \theta \left(\tfrac{1}{50} \deriv{h}{t}\right)\]
            and solve for \(\cos^2\theta\) when \(h = 40 \un{m}.\)
            But working only with \(h\) avoids this extra step.
        </aside>
        In \(\eqRefer{eq:balloon-dtheta/dt}\) we substitute \(h = 40 \un{m}\) and \(\textDeriv{h}{t} = 6 \undiv{m}{sec}\) to get 
        \[\deriv{\theta}{t} = \frac{1}{(40/50)^2 + 1} \left(\tfrac{1}{50} \cdot 6\right) = \tfrac{3}{41} \pd\]
        Thus, when the balloon is \(40 \un{m}\) above the ground, the angle of elevation is increasing 
        at a rate of \(3/41\) \(\approx 0.073 \undiv{rad}{sec}.\)
