        Using exponent laws, we find  
        \[
        3^{x + 4} = 3^x \cdot 3^4 = 81(3)^x \period
        \]
        Exponential functions are continuous for all real numbers,
        so \(f(x)\) is <u>continuous</u> at \(x = 2\).

    <span>
        The function \(\sqrt{2 - 4x}\) is defined only for \(x \leq 1/2.\)
        Radical functions are continuous over all values in their domain.
        Because \(x = 1/2\) is in the domain of \(f(x),\) 
        the function is continuous there.

    <span>
        The function \(\log_3(x - 3)\) is defined only for \(x \gt 3.\)
        Logarithmic functions are continuous in their domain.
        Because \(x = 3\) isn't included in the domain of \(\log_3(x - 3),\) 
        the function is <u>discontinuous</u> there.

        \sin(x + 1) &x \geq -1 \comma 
        \end{cases}
        \;
        x = -1

        If \(f\) is continuous at \(x = -1\), then
        \(\lim_{x \to -1} f(x) = f(-1).\)
        We take the one-sided limits to obtain 
        \[ 
        \begin{aligned} 
        \lim_{x \to -1^-} f(x) &=(-1)^2 - 3(-1) \nl
        &= 4 \comma \nl
        \lim_{x \to -1^+} f(x) &= \sin(-1 + 1) \nl
        &= 0 \period \nl
        \end{aligned} 
        \]
        Because the one-sided limits are not equivalent, 
        \(\lim_{x \to -1} f(x)\) does not exist
        and so \(f\) is 
        <u>discontinuous</u>
        at \(x = -1\).

        \(
        \ds 
        f(x)=
        \begin{cases}
        \sqrt{1 - x} &x \leq 1 \nl
        \log_4(x) &x \gt 1 \comma 
        \end{cases}  
        \; 
        x = 1
        \)
    </div>
    <span>
        If \(f\) is continuous at \(x = 1,\) then  
        \[\lim_{x \to 1} f(x) = f(1) = 0 \period \]
        We consider the one-sided limits:
        \[
        \begin{aligned} 
        \lim_{x \to 1^-} f(x) &= \sqrt{1 - 1} \nl
        &= 0 \comma \nl 
        \lim_{x \to 1^+} f(x) &= \log_4(1) \nl
        &= 0 \period \nl
        \end{aligned} 
        \] 
        Thus, because \(\lim_{x \to 1} f(x) = f(1),\) we confirm that 
        \(f(x)\) is 
        <u>continuous</u>
        at \(x = 1.\)

        The graph of \(y = 1/(x - 2)\) has a vertical asymptote at \(x = 2.\)

        We factor the numerator of \(f(x)\) to get 
        \[f(x) = \frac{(x - 3)(x - 2)}{x - 3} = x - 2 \comma x \ne 3 \period\]
        Thus, \(x = 3\) is the location of a <u>removable discontinuity</u> of \(f(x).\)

        For \(x \lt 0,\) \(f(x) = -1.\)
        For \(x \gt 0,\) \(f(x) = 1.\)
        Thus, at \(x = 0\) the graph of \(y = f(x)\) has a break—a jump from \(-1\) to \(1.\)
        Hence, \(f(x)\) has a <u>jump discontinuity</u> at \(x = 0.\)

        If \(g\) is continuous at \(x = 2,\) then 
        \[\lim_{x \to 2} g(x) = g(2) = k^2 - 8 \period\]
        The left-hand limit is

        We equate these limits to find \(k \col\)
        \[

        \]
        Find \(k\) for which \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = 4\).
    </div>
    <span>
        The left-hand limit is

        k^3 - 2k^2 + 8k - 16 &= 0 \nl
        k^2(k - 2) + 8(k - 2) &= 0 \nl

        k &= 2 \period

        Find \(p\) for which \(k(x)\) is continuous at \(x = p.\)

        The left-hand limit of \(k\) is

        Moreover, the right-hand limit is 
        \[\lim_{x \to p^+} k(x) = p^2 + 4 \period \]
        Equating these expressions and solving for \(p\) produce
        \[
        \begin{aligned}

        Find \(q\) for which \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = q\).

        The one-sided limits of \(f\) are

        \lim_{x \to q^+} f(x) &= 5e^q + 1 \period
        \ea

        We equate these expressions to obtain 
        \[
        \begin{aligned}
        e^{2q} + 7 &= 5e^q + 1 \\
        e^{2q} - 5e^q + 6 &= 0 \comma \\
        \end{aligned}
        \]
        which we factor as 
        \[(e^q - 3)(e^q - 2) \period \]
        Now we equate each factor to \(0\) to solve for \(q \col\)
        \[
        \baat{2}
        e^q - 3 &= 0 \lspace e^q - 2&&=0 \nl
        e^q &= 3 \lspace e^q &&= 2 \nl 
        q &= \ln 3 \lspace q &&= \ln 2 \period

            The piecewise function \(f\) has splits at \(x = 2\) and \(x = 5.\)
            If \(f\) is continuous, then it's continuous at these splits. 
            Thus, we need
