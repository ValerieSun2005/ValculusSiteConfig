    A function \(f\) is continuous at a value \(a\) if 
    the graph of \(y = f(x)\) is smooth at \(x = a.\)
    In other words, if we can trace the curve of \(y = f(x)\) 
    at \(x = a\)  without lifting our pen, then \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a.\)
    Formally, we say \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\) if 
    \[\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a) \period \]

    At an endpoint, it is sufficient to only consider the appropriate one-sided limit:
    If \(a\) is a left endpoint, then \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\) if \(\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a).\)
    If \(a\) is a right endpoint, then \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\) if \(\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = f(a).\)

<h4 id="classifying-discontinuities">Classifying Discontinuities</h4>
<p>
    We now learn to classify discontinuities.
    We consider three types of discontinuities: 
    removable discontinuities, jump discontinuities, and infinite discontinuities.
</p>    
<p>
    A function \(f(x)\) has a 
    <span class="emph">removable discontinuity</span>—also 
    called a 
    <span class="emph">hole</span>—at  
    at \(x = a\) if \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x)\) exists but does not equal \(f(a).\)
    Alternatively, \(f(a)\) may be undefined. 
    In 
    <a href="#determining-continuity-hole">Figure 1</a>,
    the graph of \(y = f(x)\) has a removable discontinuity at \(x = a\) because 
    \[\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = K \ne f(a) \period \]
    <figure class="determining-continuity-jump" id="determining-continuity-jump">
        <img src="../images/sectionImages/determining-continuity-jump.jpg" alt="determining-continuity-jump">
    </figure>
    We call this discontinuity <i>removable</i> because we may fill in the hole at \((a, K)\)
    to restore continuity. 
    It's also possible to define a new function \(g\) that matches \(f\) but is continuous at \(a;\)
    namely, we let 
    \[g(x) = 
    \begin{cases}
    f(x)  &x \ne a \nl 
    K &x = a \period 
    \end{cases}
    \]
</p>
<style>
    .determining-continuity-jump::before{
        content:'FIGURE 2';
    }
</style>
<p>
    The function \(f(x)\) has a 
    <span class="emph">jump discontinuity</span>
    at \(x = a\) 
    if \(\lim_{x \to a} f(x)\) does not exist but \(f(a)\) exists and both 
    \[\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) \and \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)\]
    exist and are finite 
    (<a href="#determining-continuity-jump">Figure 2</a>). 
    The name is self-explanatory: 
    a <i>jump</i> breaks the continuity in the graph of \(y = f(x)\) when \(x = a.\)
</p>

<style>
    .determining-continuity-infinite::before{
        content:'FIGURE 3';
    }
</style>
<p>
    Lastly, the function \(f(x)\) has an 
    <span class="emph">infinite discontinuity</span>
    at \(x = a\) 
    if either 
    \[\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) \or \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)\] 
    is infinite. 
    At \(x = a,\) 
    the graph of \(y = f(x)\) 
    has a <i>vertical asymptote</i>:
    \(f\) is unbounded on either side of this asymptote 
    (<a href="#determining-continuity-infinite">Figure 3</a>).

            The numerator of \(f(x)\) is a difference of squares:
            \[x^2 - 16 = (x + 4)(x - 4) \period \]
            Thus, we rewrite \(f(x)\) as 
            \[\frac{(x + 4)(x - 4)}{x + 4} = x - 4 \comma x \ne -4 \period\]
            We then see 
            \[\lim_{x \to -4} f(x) = \lim_{x \to -4} (x - 4) = -8 \period\]
            Since \(f(-4)\) is undefined, \(\lim_{x \to -4} f(x) \ne f(-4) \)
            and so \(f(x)\) has a

        <li>
            The graph of \(y = 1/(x + 3)\) has a vertical asymptote of \(x = -3.\)
            Therefore, \(x = -3\) is an 
            <span class="emph">infinite discontinuity</span>

            We find

            &= 3 \period 
            \ea 
            \]
            Since these one-handed limits are not equivalent, \(\lim_{x \to 2} f(x)\)
            does not exist.
            Therefore, this discontinuity is a

    We say \(f\) is continuous over the <i>over</i> interval \((a, b)\)

    shows the graph of \(y = f(x)\) 
    over the <i>closed</i> interval \(a \leq x \leq b.\)
    We say \(f\) is continuous at the left endpoint \(x = a\) because 
    \[\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a) \period\]
    Likewise, \(f\) is continuous at the right endpoint \(x = b\) since 
    \[\lim_{x \to b^-} f(x) = f(b) \period\]

    Consider the example 
    \[h(x) = \ln(x - 2) \comma \] 
    which is in the form \(f(g(x))\) where 
    \[f(x) = \ln x \and g(x) = x - 2 \period\]
    Since logarithms are only defined for positive inputs, 
    \(\ln x\) is continuous for \(x \gt 0.\)
    Therefore, the nested function \(g(x)\) must follow this restriction and be greater than \(0.\)
    We find 
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    g(x) &\gt 0 \\
    x - 2 &\gt 0 \\
    x &\gt 2 \period 
    \end{aligned}
    \] 
    The function \(g(x) = x - 2\) is continuous for all \(x,\) so 
    \(\ln(x - 2)\) is continuous for all \(x \gt 2\)

            The numerator
            is a sum of two continuous functions—\(\cos x\) and \(x\)—and is therefore continuous for all \(x.\)
            Conversely, the denominator \(\ln x\) is only continuous for \(x \gt 0.\)
            Therefore, \(f(x)\) is continuous for \(x \gt 0.\)
        </li>
        <hr>
        <li>
            We find the values of \(x\) such that the numerator and denominator of \(f(x)\) are both defined 
            (and the denominator \(\ne 0\)). 
            On this same interval we establish continuity for \(f(x)\) 
            since \(\tan x\) and \((x - 2)\) are continuous for all \(x\) in their domains.
            The function \(\tan x\) is continuous for all 
            \[ x \ne \pm \frac{\pi}{2} \comma \pm \frac{3 \pi}{2} \comma \pm \frac{5 \pi}{2} \comma \dots \period \]
            Also, \(x - 2 = 0\) at \(x = 2.\)
            Therefore, \(f(x)\) is discontinuous at  
            \[x = -2 \and x = \frac{\pi}{2} \pm \pi n \comma n = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \dots \period \]

            The function \(e^x\) is continuous for all \(x.\)
            But we have \(e^{\sqrt{3 - x}},\) 
            and \(\sqrt{3 - x}\) is continuous for \(x \leq 3.\)
            Thus, \(f(x)\) is continuous for all \(x \leq 3.\)
