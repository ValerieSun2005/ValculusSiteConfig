        \(\ds \deriv{y}{x} = 3x^2 + 4\)
    </div>
    <span>
        Performing Separation of Variables, we place all the \(y\)-terms on the left side and all the \(x\)-terms on the right. 
        We multiply both sides by \(\dd x\) to get 
        \[\dd y = (3x^2 + 4) \dd x \pd\]
        We now integrate both sides to get 
        \[
        \ba 
        \int \di y &= \int (3x^2 + 4) \di x \nl 
        y + C_1 &= x^3 + 4x + C_2 \pd 
        \ea 
        \] 
        No reason exists to write two constants of integration, 
        so we simply write one constant on the right-hand side:
        \[
        y = \boxed{x^3 + 4x + C}
        \]
        where \(C = C_2 - C_1.\)
    </span>

    <div>
        \(\ds \deriv{y}{x} = 4x^3 + 9x^2 - 8x + 4\)
    </div>
    <span>
        Separating variables, we multiply both sides by \(\dd x\) and integrate to get 
        \[
        \ba 
        \dd y &= (4x^3 + 9x^2 - 8x + 4) \di x \nl 
        \int \di y &= \int (4x^3 + 9x^2 - 8x + 4) \di x \nl 
        y + C_1 &= x^4 + 3x^2 - 4x^2 + 4x + C_2
        \ea 
        \]
        No reason exists to write two constants of integration,
        so for simplicity we let \(C = C_2 - C_1 \col\)
        \[y = \boxed{x^4 + 3x^2 - 4x^2 + 4x + C}\]
    </span>

    <div>
        \(\ds y' = 2x \cma y(0) = 2\)
    </div>
    <span>
        Performing Separation of Variables, 
        we write \(y'\) as \(\textDeriv{y}{x}\) and multiply both sides by \(\dd x \col\)
        \[\dd y = 2x \di x \pd\]
        Integrating both sides gives 
        \[y = x^2 + C \pd\]
        (We combine the constant of integration on the left with the constant on the right.)
        A specific solution has a value for the arbitrary constant \(C.\)
        We plug in the point \((0, 2) \col\)
        \[2 = 0^2 + C \implies C = 2 \pd\]
        Thus, the specific solution is 
        \[y = \boxed{x^2 + 2}\]
    </span>

    <div>
        \(\ds \deriv{y}{x} = 2y\)
    </div>
    <span>
        We place all the \(y\)-terms on one side and the \(x\)-terms on the other side. 
        Thus, on both sides we multiply \(\dd x\) and divide \(y \col\)
        \[\tfrac{1}{y} \di y = 2 \di x \pd\]
        We now integrate to attain 
        \[\ln|y| + C_1 = 2x + C_2 \pd\]
        We simplify this equation by writing one constant \(C,\) \(C = C_2 - C_1,\) to get 
        \[
        \ba 
        \ln|y| &= 2x + C \nl 
        y &= e^{2x + C} = e^C e^{2x} \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        Since \(C\) is an arbitrary constant, \(e^C\) is also an arbitrary constant. 
        So we simply write 
        \[y = \boxed{Ce^{2x}}\]
    </span>

    <div>
        \(\ds \deriv{y}{x} = x - \sin x \)
    </div>
    <span>
        Multiplying both sides by \(\dd x,\) we obtain 
        \[
        \dd y = (x - \sin x) \di x \pd
        \]
        Now we integrate both sides: 
        \[
        \ba 
        \int \di y &= \int(x - \sin x) \di x \nl 
        y &= \boxed{\tfrac{1}{2}x^2 + \cos x + C}
        \ea 
        \]
    </span>

    <div>
        \(\ds \deriv{y}{t} \, \cos y = 4t + 3 \cma y(1) = \pi\)
    </div>
    <span>
        We multiply both sides by \(\dd t\) to segregate the variables:
        \[\cos y \di y = (4t + 3) \di t \pd\]
        Integrating both sides then gives 
        \begin{equation} 
        \sin y = 2t^2 + 3t + C \pd \label{eq:y'cosy}
        \end{equation}
        To solve for \(C,\) we plug in the point \((1, \pi) \col\)
        \[\sin \pi = 2(1)^2 + 3(1) + C \implies C = -5 \pd\]
        \(\eqRefer{eq:y'cosy}\) then becomes 
        \[\sin y = 2t^2 + 3t - 5 \cma\]
        and we solve for \(y\) to obtain 
        \[y = \boxed{\sin^{-1}(2t^2 + 3t - 5)}\]
        Alternatively, we may first solve for \(y\) in \(\eqRefer{eq:y'cosy}\)
        and then solve for \(C.\)
    </span>

    <div>
        \(\ds t \, \deriv{y}{t} = 2\)
    </div>
    <span>
        We need one side to have all the \(y\)-terms and the other side to contain all the \(t\)-terms. 
        Thus, on both sides we divide by \(t\) and multiply by \(\dd t\) to find 
        \[\dd y = \tfrac{2}{t} \di t \pd\]
        Integrating, we obtain 
        \[
        \ba 
        \int \di y = \int \tfrac{2}{t} \di t \nl 
        y &= \boxed{2 \ln|t| + C}
        \ea 
        \]
    </span>
    
    <div>
        \(t \, y' = 1 + y^2\)
    </div>
    <span>
        We first rewrite \(y'\) as \(\textDeriv{y}{t}.\)
        Then on both sides we divide by \(t\) and divide by \(1 + y^2.\)
        This process yields 
        \[\frac{1}{1 + y^2} \di y = \frac{1}{t} \di t \pd\]
        Integrating both sides gives 
        \[
        \ba 
        \tan^{-1} y &= \ln|t| + C \nl 
        y &= \boxed{\tan \par{\ln|t| + C}}
        \ea 
        \]
    </span>

    <div>
        \(\ds y \, y' \sec x = 2\)
    </div>
    <span>
        We rewrite \(y'\) as \(\textDeriv{y}{x}.\)
        To separate the \(x\)- and \(y\)-terms, on each side we divide by \(y\) 
        and multiply by \(\sec x \di x.\)
        We then get 
        \[y \di y = 2 \cos x \pd\]
        Integrating both sides gives 
        \[
        \ba 
        \tfrac{1}{2} y^2 &= 2 \sin x + C \nl 
        y &= \boxed{2 \sqrt{\sin x + C}}
        \ea 
        \]
    </span>

    <div>
        \(\ds x^2 \, y' = y + 3\)
    </div>
    <span>
        Treating \(y'\) as \(\textDeriv{y}{x},\)
        we isolate the \(x\)- and \(y\)-terms to find 
        \[
        \ba 
        \frac{1}{y + 3} \di y &= \frac{1}{x^2} \di x \nl 
        \ln|y + 3| &= -\frac{1}{x} + C \pd
        \ea 
        \]
        To solve for \(y,\) we raise both sides to the power of \(e \col\) 
        \[
        \ba 
        y + 3 &= e^{-1/x + C} \nl 
        y &= \boxed{Ce^{-1/x} - 3}
        \ea 
        \]
    </span>

    <div>
        \(\ds y \, \deriv{y}{t} = t \, \sqrt{1 - y^2}\)
    </div>
    <span>
        We divide both sides by \(\sqrt{1 - y^2}\) and multiply both sides by \(\dd t \col\)
        \begin{equation}
        \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \di y = t \di t \pd \label{eq:yy'}
        \end{equation}
        We now integrate both sides. For \(\int (y/\sqrt{1 - y^2}) \di y,\) we substitute 
        \[
        \ba 
        u &= 1 - y^2 \nl 
        \dd u &= -2y \di y \pd
        \ea 
        \]
        The integral then becomes
        \[-\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{u}} \di u = - \sqrt{u} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \pd \]
        (We neglect the constant of integration.)
        \(\eqRefer{eq:yy'}\) then becomes 
        \[-\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \tfrac{1}{2} t^2 + C \pd\]
        Now we solve for \(y\) as follows:
        \[
        \ba 
        1 - y^2 &= \par{\tfrac{1}{2} t^2 + C}^2 \nl
        y &= \boxed{\pm\sqrt{1 -  \par{\tfrac{1}{2} t^2 + C}^2}} 
        \ea 
        \]
    </span>

        By substituting \(y' = u,\) show that a general solution to 
        \[y'' + y' = 0\]
        is \(y = C_1 e^{-x} + C_2.\)
    </div>
    <span>
        The substitution \(y' = u\) gives 
        \[u' + u = 0 \cma\]
        which we rewrite as a separable first-order differential equation: 
        \[\deriv{u}{x} = -u \pd\]
        On both sides we multiply by \(\dd x\) and divide by \(u.\) We get  
        \[
        \ba 
        \tfrac{1}{u} \di u &= - \di x \nl 
        \ln|u| &= -x + C_1 \nl 
        u &= C_1 e^{-x} \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        Remember that \(u = y',\) so we substitute back to find 
        \[
        \ba 
        \deriv{y}{x} &= C_1 e^{-x} \nl 
        \int \di y &= \int C_1 e^{-x} \di x \nl 
        y &= -C_1 e^{-x} + C_2 \pd
        \ea 
        \]
        A final remark is that \(-C_1\) is equivalent to \(C_1\) because they are both arbitrary constants. 
        We therefore make this change to obtain  
        \[y = \boxed{C_1 e^{-x} + C_2}\]
        Just as solving a first-order differential equation confers one constant of integration, 
        the solution of a second-order differential equation has two arbitrary constants.

        A <i>capacitor</i> is a device that stores electrical energy on one of its conducting plates. 
        Capacitance is the ability of a capacitor's plate to hold a charge \(Q.\)
        The apparatus of 
        <a href="#diff-eq-capacitor">Figure 1</a>
        shows a capacitor of capacitance \(C\) connected to an appliance of resistance \(R.\)
        (This configuration is called an <i>RC circuit</i>.)
        As current travels through the circuit, the resistance dissipates the charge of the capacitor as modeled by the differential equation
        \[\frac{Q}{C} + R \frac{\dd Q}{\dd t} = 0 \pd \]
        Initially, the capacitor's plate holds charge \(Q_0.\)
        Find the specific solution \(Q(t),\) the function that represents the charge on the capacitor at a given time \(t.\)
    </div>
    <span>
        We first isolate \(\textDeriv{Q}{t} \col\)  
        \[\deriv{Q}{t} = -\frac{Q}{RC} \pd\]
        Now we perform Separation of Variables, placing all the \(Q\) terms on the left-hand side: 
        \[
        \ba
        \frac{1}{Q} \di Q &= -\frac{1}{RC} \di t \nl 
        \ln|Q| &= -\frac{t}{RC} + K \nl  
        \ea 
        \]
        where \(K\) is the constant of integration.
        Raising both sides to the power of \(e\) yields 
        \[Q = e^{(-t/RC) + K} = Ke^{-t/RC} \pd\]  
        We now solve for \(K\) by noting that when \(t = 0,\) \(Q(t) = Q_0.\)
        So we get 
        \[
        Q_0 = Ke^{0} \implies K = Q_0 \pd
        \]
        Therefore, the solution becomes 
        \[Q(t) = \boxed{Q_0 e^{-t/RC}}\]
        This model demonstrates that the charge on the capacitor's plate decreases exponentially with time.

        Water flows out of a cylindrical tank of water level \(H\) (<a href="#diff-eq-tank">Figure 2</a>).
        <i>Torricelli’s Law</i> states that the water level decreases with time 
        at a rate proportional to the square root of the water level, 
        as modeled by the differential equation 
        \[\deriv{H}{t} = -k \sqrt{H} \pd\]
        Initially, the water level in the tank is \(16 \un{ft}.\)
        After \(10\) minutes, the water level is \(9 \un{ft}.\)
        Find the specific solution \(H(t),\) the function that represents the water level in the tank at time \(t.\) 
    </div>
    <span>
        Let's first find the general solution \(H(t).\)
        We isolate the variables, getting 
        \begin{align}
        H^{-1/2} \di H &= -k \di t \nonumber \nl 
        \tfrac{1}{2} \sqrt{H} &= -kt + C \pd \label{eq:tank-1}
        \end{align}
        We now solve for \(k\) and \(C \col\)
        When \(t = 0,\) \(H = 16.\) Thus, we get 
        \[\tfrac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{16} = 0 + C \implies C = 2 \pd\]
        When \(t = 10,\) \(H = 9.\) We then find 
        \[\tfrac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{9} = -10k + 2 \implies k = -\tfrac{1}{20} \pd \]
        Therefore, \(\eqRefer{eq:tank-1}\) becomes 
        \[
        \ba 
        \tfrac{1}{2} \sqrt{H} &= -\tfrac{1}{20} t + 2 \nl 
        H &= \boxed{\par{4 - \tfrac{1}{10}t}^2}
        \ea 
        \]
