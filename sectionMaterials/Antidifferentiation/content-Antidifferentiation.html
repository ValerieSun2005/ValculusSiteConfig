<!--[[[crefId.Antidifferentiation]]]-->
<p>
    In Section <!--[[[cref.Defining-a-Derivative]]]--> we asserted a derivative measures a function's rate of change.
    If we have the rate \(f'(x)\) and want to find \(f(x),\) then we use <i>antidifferentiation</i>.
    Antidifferentiation has many applications: 
    If we have a particle's velocity, then we can find its position at a given time.
    If we know an ecosystem's growth factor, then we can model the population at a given time.
    In this section we'll be

    <span class="emph">Antidifferentiation</span>
    is the inverse operation of differentiation:
    If function \(g'\) is the derivative of \(g,\)
    then \(g\) is an <i>antiderivative</i> of \(g'.\)
    To generalize this principle, 
    we say that function \(F\) is an <span class="emph">antiderivative</span>
    of \(f\) if \(F' = f.\)
    For example, an antiderivative of \(h(x) = x^2\) is \(H(x) = \frac{1}{3} x^3\)
    because \(H'(x) = x^2 = h(x).\) 
    But \(H(x) = \frac{1}{3} x^3 + 2\) is also <i>an</i> antiderivative of \(f.\)
    Therefore, any function \(H(x) = \frac{1}{3} x^3 + C,\) where \(C\) is a constant,
    is an antiderivative of \(h.\)
    If a function has an antiderivative, then the function has <i>infinitely</i>
    many antiderivatives—all of which differ by a constant. 
    <a href="#antidiff-x3">Figure 1</a> shows the graphs of some antiderivatives of \(h(x) = x^2,\)
    in which all graphs take the form \(y = \frac{1}{3} x^3 + C\) and therefore differ by a vertical translation.

<p>
    The symbol for the antidifferentiation operator is "\(\int \,\)";
    for example, for \(h(x) = x^2,\)
    \begin{equation} 
    H(x) = \int h(x) \di x = \int x^2 \di x = \tfrac{1}{3} x^3 + C \pd \label{eq:int-h(x)}
    \end{equation}
    The term \(\dd x\) specifies that we antidifferentiate with respect to \(x.\)
    Note the following terminology in \(\eqRefer{eq:int-h(x)} \col\)
    <ul>
        <li>
            "\(\int \,\)" is the <span class="emph">integral sign</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
            \(h(x) = x^2\) is the <span class="emph">integrand</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
            \(\dd x\) is the <span class="emph">differential</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
            \(C\) is the <span class="emph">constant of integration</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
            \(H(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + C\) is an <span class="emph">antiderivative</span> of \(h(x).\)
        </li>
        <li>
            The entire expression \(\int h(x) \di x\) is an 
            <span class="emph">indefinite integral</span>.
        </li>
    </ul>
    The verbs <i>antidifferentiate</i> and <i>integrate</i> are often used interchangeably.
    An integral that contains bounds—for example, \(\int_1^3 x^3 \di x\)—is called a <i>definite integral</i>.
    Whereas an <i>indefinite</i> integral returns an antiderivative (a function),
    a <i>definite</i> integral returns a value.
    We will explore definite integrals in Section <!--[[[cref.Fundamental-Theorem-of-Calculus]]]-->,
    in which we connect antiderivatives to calculating areas bounded by curves.

    To obtain antidifferentiation statements, we read differentiation statements from right to left.
    For example, 
    \[
    \baat{2}
    &\deriv{}{x} [\sin x] = {\color{orange} \cos x} &&\Longleftrightarrow \int {\color{orange} \cos x} \di x = \sin x + C \nl 
    &\deriv{}{x} [-\cos x] = {\color{orange} \sin x} &&\Longleftrightarrow \int {\color{orange} \sin x} \di x = -\cos x + C \nl
    &\deriv{}{x} [\tan x] = {\color{orange} \sec^2 x} &&\Longleftrightarrow \int {\color{orange} \sec^2 x} \di x = \tan x + C \nl
    &\deriv{}{x} [\sec x] = {\color{orange} \sec x \tan x} &&\Longleftrightarrow \int {\color{orange} \sec x \tan x} \di x = \sec x + C \nl
    &\deriv{}{x}  \left[\sin^{-1} x\right] = {\color{orange}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}} 
        &&\Longleftrightarrow \int {\color{orange}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}} \di x = \sin^{-1} x + C \nl
    &\deriv{}{x}  \left[\tan^{-1} x\right] = {\color{orange}\frac{1}{1 + x^2}}

    &\deriv{}{x}  \left[e^x\right] = \orange{e^x} &&\Longleftrightarrow \int \orange{e^x} \di x = e^x + C \pd 
    \eaat 
    \]
    Formally, each differentiation statement should include a constant—for example, \(\textDeriv{}{x} \, [\sin x + C] = \cos x.\)
    This list drops the constants in the differentiation statements for the sake of familiarity.

            This problem asks: "The derivative of what function is \(\cos x \ques\)" 
            And one such function is \(\sin x.\)
            But the derivative of \(\sin x\) plus any constant—for example, the derivative of 
            \((\sin x + 1)\) or of \((\sin x - 100)\)—is also \(\cos x.\)

    If \(f(x) = x^n,\) where \(n \ne -1,\) then the <span class="emph">reverse power rule</span> 
    gives an antiderivative of \(f\) to be
    \begin{equation} 
    F(x) = \frac{x^{n + 1}}{n + 1} \pd \label{eq:reverse-power-rule}
    \end{equation}
    In words, \(\eqRefer{eq:reverse-power-rule}\) states that to find an antiderivative of a power function
    (if the power isn't \(-1\)), 
    we add one to the power and divide by the result. 
    This fact is easy to verify because \(F'(x) = x^n = f(x).\)
    For example, if \(n = 4,\) then using \(\eqref{eq:reverse-power-rule}\) gives 
    \begin{equation} 
    \int x^4 \di x = \frac{x^{4 + 1}}{4 + 1} + C = \frac{x^5}{5} + C \pd \label{eq:int-x^4}
    \end{equation}
    We accept this answer because \(\textDeriv{}{x}\,\left[\frac{1}{5}x^5 + C\right] = x^4,\)
    which matches the integrand in \(\eqref{eq:int-x^4}.\) Additionally, if \(n = 0\) then 
    \begin{equation} 
    \int x^0 \di x = \int \dd x = \frac{x^{0 + 1}}{0 + 1} + C = x + C \pd \label{eq:int-n=0}
    \end{equation}
    In \(\int \dd x,\) the integrand is <span class="warning">not</span>
    \(0;\) rather, \(\int \dd x = \int 1 \di x.\)
    And \(\textDeriv{}{x}\,[x + C] = 1,\) thus affirming the result in \(\eqRefer{eq:int-n=0}.\)
    But if \(n = -1,\) then an antiderivative of \(f(x) = x^n\) is \(\ln|x|,\)
    as we asserted in (iii) of <a href="#ex-1">Example 1</a>.
</p>
<aside class="box-remark">
    It is common to see expressions like \(\int \dd x/x^2,\)
    whose meaning is identical to \(\int \frac{1}{x^2} \di x.\)
    Likewise, when an integrand contains a sum or difference,
    using parentheses is a stylistic decision:
    Some people write \(\int (2x - 3)\di x,\)
    while others prefer \(\int 2x - 3 \di x.\)
    Both expressions carry the same meaning.

    If functions \(f\) and \(g\) have antiderivatives \(F\) and \(G,\)
    respectively, then 
    \begin{equation} 
    \int f(x) \pm g(x) \di x = \int f(x) \di x \pm \int g(x) \di x = F(x) \pm G(x) + C \pd \label{eq:int-sum}
    \end{equation}
    If \(k\) is a constant, then 
    \begin{equation} 
    \int kf(x) \di x = k \int f(x) \di x = kF(x) + C \pd \label{eq:int-constant}
    \end{equation}
    Antiderivatives are said to be <i>linear</i> because they satisfy \(\eqref{eq:int-sum}\) and \(\eqref{eq:int-constant}.\)
    In \(\eqRefer{eq:int-sum},\) \(\int f(x) \di x\) and \(\int g(x) \di x\) 
    each output a constant of integration; we write the sum or difference of these constants simply as \(C,\)
    because adding or subtracting two constants gives another <i>arbitrary</i> constant.
    By similar logic, multiplying or dividing a constant of integration by a number does <i>not</i>
    alter the identity of the constant—the constant can still be <i>any</i> value.  
    For example, if \(C\) is a constant of integration, then we may write expressions such as 
    \(2C\) and \(C + 100\) simply as \(C.\)

    An equation that relates \(f\) and its derivatives is called a
    <span class="emph">differential equation</span>.
    In calculus, we often have a rate \(f'\) and need to find a <i>solution</i> \(f.\)
    (Differential equations are fundamental to modeling natural phenomena, 
    which we discuss further in Section <!--[[[cref.Modeling-with-Differential-Equations]]]-->.)
    We often want \(f\) that satisfies a specific point, called an 
    <span class="emph">initial condition</span>. 
    To find \(f\) given \(f'\) and an initial condition, we first integrate \(f'.\)
    Doing so produces a 
    <span class="emph">general solution</span>
    that contains a constant of integration. 
    We then plug in the initial condition to solve for this constant. 
    For example, if \(f'(x) = 2x\) and \(\orange{f(1) = 2},\)
    then we antidifferentiate \(f'(x)\) and substitute the given initial condition to solve for the constant of integration:
    \begin{align} 
    f(x) = \int 2x \di x &= x^2 + C \nonumber \nl 
    \orange{f(1)} &= (1)^2 + C = \orange{2} \implies C = 1 \pd \nonumber \nl 
    \therefore f(x) &= \boxed{x^2 + 1} \label{eq:diff-eq-f(x)-particular}

    \(\eqRefer{eq:diff-eq-f(x)-particular}\) is called the

    The <b>key idea</b> to sketching \(y = F(x)\) is that 
    at any point \(x,\) the slope of \(F(x)\) is \(f(x).\)
    In <a href="#antidiff-ex-graph-f-antideriv">Figure 3</a>
    we begin the graph at the point \((0, 2).\)
    We make the following remarks about the first derivative of \(F,\)
    \(f \col\)
    <ul>
        <li>
            When \(0 \lt x \lt 1\) and \(x \gt 3,\) \(f\) is negative, meaning the slope of \(F\) is negative.
            Thus, \(F\) is <i>decreasing</i> on these intervals.
        </li>
        <li>
            For \(1 \lt x \lt 3,\) \(f\) is positive, so the slope of \(F\) is positive.
            Therefore, \(F\) is <i>increasing</i> on this interval.
        </li>
        <li>
            Since \(f(1) = 0\) and \(f(3) = 0,\) \(F\) has horizontal tangents when \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3.\)
            By the First Derivative Test (see Section <!--[[[cref.Minimum-and-Maximum-Values]]]-->),
            \(F(1)\) is a local <i>minimum</i> because \(F' = f\) changes sign from negative to positive at \(x = 1,\)
            and \(F(3)\) is a local <i>maximum</i> because \(F' = f\) changes sign from positive to negative at \(x = 3.\)
        </li>
    </ul>
    We now consider the graph's shape using the second derivative of \(F,\) \(f' \col\)
    <ul>
        <li>
            \(F''(2) = f'(2) = 0,\) so \(F\) has an inflection point when \(x = 2.\)
        </li>
        <li>
            \(F'' = f' \gt 0\) for \(0 \lt x \lt 2,\) so \(F\) is concave <i>up</i> on this interval. 
            In contrast, \(F'' = f' \lt 0\) when \(x \gt 2,\) so \(F\) is concave <i>down</i> for \(x \gt 2.\)

<h4 id="pos-vel-acc">Position, Velocity, and Acceleration</h4>
<p>
    In Section <!--[[[cref.Particle-Motion]]]--> we connected position to velocity and acceleration using derivatives.
    These relationships are examples of differential equations.
    We now relate these quantities using integrals, and we have the tools to solve these differential equations.
    If \(s(t)\) represents an object's position at time \(t,\) 
    then the particle's <i>velocity</i> function is \(v(t) = \textDeriv{s}{t}.\)
    Thus, the reverse statement is that \(s(t)\) is the integral of \(v(t)\) with respect to time:
    \begin{equation} 
    s(t) = \int v(t) \di t \pd \label{eq:s(t)=intv(t)}
    \end{equation}
    <i>Acceleration</i>, \(a(t),\) is the derivative of velocity, so
    velocity is the integral of acceleration:
    \begin{equation} 
    v(t) = \int a(t) \di t \pd \label{eq:v(t)=inta(t)}

        Velocity is the integral of acceleration [\(\eqRefer{eq:v(t)=inta(t)}\)].
        The particle's <i>general</i> velocity function is then  
        \begin{align} 
        v(t) &= \int 4t + 6 \di t \nonumber \nl 
        &= 2t^2 + 6t + C \cma \label{eq:particle-xaxis-v(t)}

        To find the particle's <i>particular</i> velocity function,
        in which \(C\) has a value,
        we note that the particle's initial velocity is \(\orange{v(0) = 3}.\)
        Substituting this point in \(\eqref{eq:particle-xaxis-v(t)}\) gives 
        \[\orange{v(0)} = 2(0)^2 + 6(0) + C = \orange 3 \implies C = 3 \pd\]
        Thus, \(\eqref{eq:particle-xaxis-v(t)}\) becomes

        Position is the integral of velocity [\(\eqref{eq:s(t)=intv(t)}\)],

        \end{align}
        where \(D\) is a constant.
        To solve for \(D\) we plug into \(\eqref{eq:particle-xaxis-x(t)}\) the initial condition \(\orange{x(0) = 2}\) 
        to obtain 
        \[\orange{x(0)} = \tfrac{2}{3}(0)^3 + 3(0)^2 + 3(0) + D = \orange 2 \implies D = 2 \pd\]
        Thus, \(\eqRefer{eq:particle-xaxis-x(t)}\) becomes

        x(t) = \boxed{\tfrac{2}{3} t^3 + 3t^2 + 3t + 2} \label{eq:particle-xaxis-x(t)-particular}

        To check our answer, we need to verify that \(\eqRefer{eq:particle-xaxis-x(t)-particular}\)

        It's easy to see that \(\eqref{eq:particle-xaxis-x(t)-particular}\)
        satisfies \(\orange{x(0) = 2} \col\)
        \[\orange{x(0)} = \tfrac{2}{3}(0)^3 + 3(0)^2 + 3(0) + 2 \equalsCheck \orange{2} \pd\]
        Moreover, differentiating \(\eqref{eq:particle-xaxis-x(t)-particular}\) shows

        x'(t) = v(t) = 2t^2 + 6t + 3 \pd \label{eq:particle-xaxis-x(t)-particular-diff}

<h4 id="freefalling-objects">Freefalling Objects</h4>
<p>
    On Earth's surface, the acceleration due to gravity is \(g,\) whose value is \(32 \undiv{ft}{sec}^2\) 
    or \(9.8 \undiv{m}{sec}^2.\)
    When objects fall, we select a direction to be positive and a direction to be negative.
    It's intuitive to assign the positive direction to be upward,
    and let the object's position function represent its <i>height</i> above the ground.
    For example, when an object is thrown upward, its initial velocity is positive and its acceleration is \(-g.\)
    Conversely, as an object falls to the ground, its velocity is always negative and its acceleration is \(-g.\)
    Let's make a few remarks about freefalling objects:

<div id="solution6" class="solution">
    <p>
        Since the rock is dropped from rest, its initial velocity is \(0\) (<a href="#remark-1">Remark 1</a>).
        Its initial position is \(100 \un{ft}.\)
        We take the positive direction to be upward; the rock's velocity and acceleration are therefore 
        both negative as it falls.
    </p>
    <p>
        By \(\eqRefer{eq:v(t)=inta(t)},\) the rock's velocity function is the integral of acceleration.
        The acceleration due to gravity is \(g = -32 \undiv{ft}{sec}^2,\)
        so we get 
        \begin{align} 
        v(t) &= \int -32 \di t \nonumber \nl 
        &= -32t + C \cma \label{eq:rock-v(t)-general}
        \end{align}
        where \(C\) is a constant of integration. 
        To solve for \(C\) we
        substitute in \(\eqref{eq:rock-v(t)-general}\) the initial condition \(\orange{v(0) = 0} \col\)
        \[\orange{v(0)} = -32(0) + C = \orange 0 \implies C = 0 \pd\]
        Thus, the rock's velocity function is

        h(t) = -16t^2 + D \cma \label{eq:rock-h(t)-general}
        \end{equation}
        where \(D\) is a constant. 
        Function \(h(t)\) represents the rock's <i>height</i> above the ground,
        so this model has the initial condition \(\orange{h(0) = 100}.\)
        In \(\eqref{eq:rock-h(t)-general}\) we substitute this initial condition
        to solve for \(D \col\)
        \[\orange{h(0)} = -16(0)^2 + D = \orange{100} \implies D = 100 \pd\]
        Thus, \(\eqRefer{eq:rock-h(t)-general}\) becomes 
        \begin{equation} 
        h(t) = \boxed{-16t^2 + 100} \label{eq:rock-h(t)-ans}

        The rock's final velocity is <span class="warning">not \(0\)</span> (<a href="#remark-2">Remark 2</a>);
        it is instead the rock's velocity <i>right before</i> it hits the ground—when 
        \(h(t) = 0.\)
        Equating \(\eqref{eq:rock-h(t)-ans}\) to \(0\) and solving for the positive value of \(t,\) we have 
        \[-16t^2 + 100 = 0 \implies t = \tfrac{10}{4} = 2.5 \pd\]
        The ball therefore hits the ground after \(2.5\) seconds.
        In \(\eqRefer{eq:rock-v(t)-particular}\) we substitute \(t = 2.5 \col\)
        \[v(t) = -32(2.5) = -80 \pd\]
        Speed is the magnitude (absolute value) of velocity, so
