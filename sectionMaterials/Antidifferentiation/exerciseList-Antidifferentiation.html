        The derivative of \(-\cos x\) is \(\sin x.\)
        Thus, \(-\cos x\) is an <i>antiderivative</i> of \(\sin x.\)
        The general antiderivative of \(\sin x\)
        is \(-\cos x + C,\) where \(C\) is a constant.
        So 
        \[\int \sin x \di x = \boxed{- \cos x + C}\]

        \(\ds \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \di x\)

        Since the derivative of \(\sin^{-1} x\) is \(1/\sqrt{1 - x^2},\) 
        an <i>antiderivative</i> of \(1/\sqrt{1 - x^2}\) is \(\sin^{-1} x.\)
        The general antiderivative of \(1/\sqrt{1 - x^2}\) is \(\sin^{-1} x + C;\)
        therefore, 
        \[\int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \di x = \boxed{\sin^{-1} x + C}\]

        We write the integrand as \(x^{1/3}\) and antidifferentiate using the reverse power rule:

        Writing the integrand as \(x^{-3},\) we antidifferentiate using the reverse power rule:
        \[\int x^{-3} \di x = \frac{x^{-3 + 1}}{-3 + 1} + C= -\tfrac{1}{2} x^{-2} + C = \boxed{-\frac{1}{2x^2} + C}\]

        By the linearity property of integrals, we split the integral as 
        \[\int 3y \di y- \int 5 \di y \pd\]
        The same property allows us to pull out the constants in each integral, so we obtain 
        \[3 \int y \di y - 5 \int \di y \pd\]
        Using the reverse power rule then gives

        \(\ds \int 2t - \cos t \di t\)

        Since integrals exhibit the property of linearity, we split the integral.
        Breaking the integral into two and pulling out constants give 
        \begin{equation} 
        2 \int t \di t - \int \cos t \di t \pd \label{eq:2t-cost-dt}
        \end{equation}
        We use the reverse power rule to evaluate the first integral, 
        and the second integral (without regard to the negative sign) is \(\sin t.\)
        Thus, \(\eqref{eq:2t-cost-dt}\) becomes 
        \[2 \frac{t^{1 + 1}}{1 + 1} - (\sin t) + C = \boxed{t^2 - \sin t + C}\]

        \(\ds \int \pi^2 \di x \)

        The integrand, \(\pi^2,\) is a constant.

        \(\ds \int u \sqrt u \di u\)

    <span>
        We write the integrand as \(u \cdot u^{1/2} = u^{3/2}.\)
        Then using the reverse power rule, we obtain, as the general antiderivative,

        We express all terms as powers. We then break up the integral into three and pull out constants: 
        \begin{equation} 
        3 \int x^{-1} \di x + \int x^{-1/2} \di x - 3 \int x^2 \di x \pd \label{eq:3/x+}
        \end{equation}
        The first integral is \(\ln|x|,\) 
        while the others require the reverse power rule. 
        Thus, \(\eqref{eq:3/x+}\) becomes 
        \[3 \ln|x| + \frac{x^{1 - 1/2}}{1 - 1/2} - 3 \frac{x^{2 + 1}}{2 + 1} + C = \boxed{3 \ln|x| + 2 \sqrt x - x^3 + C}\]

        We expand the integrand as 
        \[2x^2 + 5x - 12 \pd\]
        We then integrate this expression using the reverse power rule, obtaining 
        \[\boxed{\tfrac{2}{3} x^3 + \tfrac{5}{2} x^2 - 12x + C}\]

        \[\int 3x + 6 - \frac{\sqrt x}{x^2} \di x = \int 3x + 6 - x^{-3/2} \di x \pd\]
        Using the reverse power rule on each term, we obtain

        A penny is dropped from the roof of a \(50\)-foot building.
        Find \(h(t),\) the penny's height above the ground
        as a function of time, in seconds.
        Determine the penny's speed right before it hits the ground.
    </div>
    <span>
        Since the penny is <i>dropped</i>, its initial velocity is \(v(0) = 0.\)
        Because we want the penny's height function, we let the upward direction be positive; 
        thus, the object's acceleration due to gravity is \(-g = -32 \undiv{ft}{sec}^2.\)
        We integrate this value to obtain the penny's general velocity function:
        \[v(t) = \int -32 \di t = -32t + C \pd\]
        To solve for \(C\) we substitute the initial condition \(\orange{v(0) = 0} \col\)
        \[\orange{v(0)} = -32(0) + C = \orange 0 \implies C = 0 \pd\]
        Thus, the penny's velocity function is 
        \[v(t) = -32t \pd \]
        The penny's height function is \(h(t) = \int v(t) \di t,\)
        and this model takes the initial condition \(\orange{h(0) = 50}.\)
        Integrating, we have 
        \[h(t) = -16t^2 + D \pd\]
        To solve for \(D\) we substitute the initial condition \(\orange{h(0) = 50}:\)
        \[\orange{h(0)} = -16(0)^2 + D = \orange{50} \implies D = 50 \pd\]
        Hence, the penny's height at time \(t\) is 
        \[h(t) = \boxed{-16t^2 + 50}\]
        To find the penny's final velocity \(v_f,\) we find the time at which \(h(t) = 0.\)
        We get 
        \[-16t^2 + 50 = 0 \implies t = \frac{5}{2 \sqrt 2} \pd\]
        Then 
        \[v_f = v \par{\frac{5}{2 \sqrt 2}} = -32 \par{\frac{5}{2 \sqrt 2}} = -40 \sqrt 2 \pd\]
        Speed is the magnitude (absolute value) of velocity,
        so the penny's final <i>speed</i> is \(|-40 \sqrt 2|\) \(\approx 56.569 \undiv{ft}{sec}.\)

        A pencil rolls off a desk that is \(6\) feet above the ground. 
        How long does the pencil take to hit the ground?
    </div>
    <span>
        We need to choose an axis orientation. 
        It is logical to let up be positive; then the pencil's acceleration due to gravity is 
        \(-32 \undiv{ft}{sec}^2.\)
        We find the pencil's velocity function by integrating this value of acceleration with respect to time:
        \[v(t) = \int -32 \di t = -32t + C \pd\]
        The pencil <i>rolls</i> off the desk, so its initial velocity is \(\orange{v(0) = 0}.\)
        Substituting this initial condition gives 
        \[\orange{v(0)} = -32(0) + C = \orange 0 \implies C = 0 \pd\]
        Hence, the pencil's velocity function is 
        \(v(t) = -32t.\)
        The pencil's height function is the integral of \(v(t)\) with respect to timeâ€”that is, 
        \[h(t) = \int -32 t \di t = -16t^2 + D \pd\]
        The pencil initially is \(6\) feet above the ground; thus, \(\orange{h(0) = 6}.\)
        Substituting this initial value shows 
        \[\orange{h(0)} = -16(0)^2 + D = \orange 6 \implies D = 6 \pd\]
        Thus, the pencil's height function is 
        \[h(t) = -16t^2 + 6 \pd\]
        We want to find the positive value of \(t\) for which \(h(t) = 0,\) so we solve to find 
        \[t = \sqrt{\frac{6}{16}} \approx \boxed{0.612 \un{sec}}\]

        (where \(t\) is time),
        to find the time when the rock hits the bottom of the canyon.
        We choose up to be the positive direction, so the rock's acceleration due to gravity 
        is \(-g = -32 \undiv{ft}{sec}^2.\)
        We integrate this acceleration to find the rock's general velocity function:
        \[v(t) = \int -32 \di t = -32t + C \pd\] 
        To solve for \(C\) we substitute the initial condition \(\orange{v(0) = -20} \col\)
        \[\orange{v(0)} = -32(0) + C = \orange{-20} \implies C = -20 \pd\]
        Hence, the rock's velocity function is 
        \[v(t) = -32t - 20 \pd\]
        We then integrate \(v(t)\) to find the rock's position function, \(h(t).\) 
        Giving this model the initial condition \(\orange{h(0) = 180}\)
        ensures that \(h(t)\) represents the rock's <i>height</i> above the canyon's bottom.
        We have 
        \[h(t) = \int -32t - 20 \di t = -16t^2 - 20t + D \pd\]
        To solve for \(D\) we substitute the initial condition:
        \[\orange{h(0)} = -16(0)^2 - 20(0) + D = \orange{180} \implies D = 180 \pd\]
        Thus, the rock's height function is 
        \begin{equation*} 
        h(t) = -16t^2 - 20t + 180 \pd 
        \end{equation*}
        We want the positive solution of \(h(t) = 0 \col\)
        \[
        \ba 
        t &= \frac{20 \pm \sqrt{(-20)^2 - 4(-16)(180)}}{2(-16)} \nl 
        t &\approx -4.037, t \approx 2.787 \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        Therefore, the rock takes \(2.787 \un{sec}\) to fall to the bottom of the canyon.
        And the rock hits the bottom with a <i>speed</i> of 
        \[|v(2.787)| = |-32(2.787) - 20| = \boxed{109.184 \undiv{ft}{sec}}\]

        A teddy bear is thrown from the ground straight upward with an initial speed of \(19.6\) meters per second.
        What is the maximum height above the ground that the teddy bear reaches?
    </div>
    <span>  
        Let's take the upward direction to be positive.
        Then the teddy bear's acceleration due to gravity is \(-9.8 \undiv{m}{sec}^2.\)
        If \(t\) is time in seconds, then the bear's general velocity function is therefore 
        \[v(t) = \int -9.8 \di t = -9.8 t + C \pd\]
        To determine \(C\) we substitute the initial condition \(\orange{v(0) = 19.6} \col\)
        \[\orange{v(0)} = -9.8(0) + C = \orange{19.6} \implies C = 19.6 \pd\]
        Hence, the bear's velocity function is 
        \begin{equation} 
        v(t) = -9.8t + 19.6 \pd \label{eq:bear-velocity}
        \end{equation}
        We want to find \(h(t),\) the bear's height as a function of time. 
        We want to impose the initial condition \(\orange{h(0) = 0}\) because then \(h\) 
        represents the bear's height above the ground.
        Integrating the bear's velocity function [\(\eqref{eq:bear-velocity}\)] yields 
        \[h(t) = -4.9t^2 + 19.6t + D \pd\]
        Plugging in the initial condition then shows 
        \[\orange{h(0)} = -4.9(0)^2 + 19.6(0) + D = \orange 0 \implies D = 0 \pd \]
        Then the bear's height from the ground is 
        \[h(t) = -4.9t^2 + 19.6t \pd\]
        When the bear reaches its maximum height, \(v = 0.\)
        In \(\eqRefer{eq:bear-velocity}\) setting \(v(t) = 0\) gives \(t = 2.\)
        Hence, the bear's maximum height is 
        \[h(2) = -4.9(2)^2 + 19.6(2) = \boxed{19.6 \un{m}}\]

        A marshmallow is launched up into the air.
        After \(2\) seconds the marshmallow reaches its maximum height.
        Determine the marshmallow's launch velocity in feet per second.
    </div>
    <span>
        We select the up direction to be positive. 
        Then the marshmallow's acceleration due to gravity is \(-32 \undiv{ft}{sec}^2.\)
        The marshmallow's velocity as a function of time is the integral of this acceleration:
        \[v(t) = \int -32 \di t = -32 t + C \pd\]
        To solve for \(C,\) we note that the marshmallow's velocity is \(0\) when it is at its maximum height, after \(2 \un{sec}.\)
        Thus, we substitute the initial condition \(\orange{v(2) = 0} \col\)
        \[\orange{v(2)} = -32(2) + C = \orange 0 \implies C = 64 \pd\]
        Hence, the marshmallow's velocity function is 
        \[v(t) = -32t + 64 \pd\]
        Its launch velocity is therefore \(v(0) = 64 \undiv{ft}{sec}.\)

        An object's acceleration as a function of time varies directly with time 
        raised to the power of \(n,\) a positive number.
        With what degree of time does the object's position vary?
    </div>
    <span>
        The object's acceleration takes the form 
        \[a(t) = kt^n \cma\]
        where \(k\) is a constant.
        Velocity, \(v(t),\) is the integral of acceleration with respect to time; thus, 
        \[v(t) = k \, \frac{t^{n + 1}}{n + 1} + C \pd\]
        If we integrate again, then the power of the \(t\) becomes \(n + 2.\)
        Thus, the object's position varies directly with \(t\) to the power of \(n + 2.\)

                Position is the integral of velocity, so we integrate \(\eqref{eq:particle-v(t)-ans},\) obtaining
