    In the world, many phenomena require efficiency. 
    Therefore, locating the <i>extrema</i>—the minima or maxima—of a model
    is a fundamental skill of calculus.
    In this section, we define the forms of extrema:
    We begin with <a class="page-anchor" href="#absolute-extrema">Absolute Extrema</a>, 
    which we define using the <a class="page-anchor" href="#extreme-value-theorem">Extreme Value Theorem</a>. 
    Then we examine <a class="page-anchor" href="#critical-points">Critical Points</a>
    to define <a class="page-anchor" href="#relative-extrema">Relative Extrema</a>. 
    This section culminates in the 
    <a class="page-anchor" href="#closed-interval-method">Closed Interval Method</a>,
    a problem-solving strategy for finding extrema.

<h4 id="absolute-extrema">Absolute Extrema</h4>
<p>
    <a href="#min-max-abs-max">Figure 1</a> shows the graph of \(y = g(x).\)
    We say \(g(1) = 8/3\) is the <i>absolute minimum</i> of \(g\) because \((1, 8/3)\) is the <i>lowest</i> point on the graph. 
    Conversely, \(g(3) = 4\) is the <i>absolute maximum</i> of \(g\) because \((3, 4)\) is the <i>highest</i> point on the graph.
    Each of these values is an <i>absolute extremum</i> (plural, <i>extrema</i>) of \(g.\)
    To formally define these terms, 
    consider \(f(x)\) for \(a \leq x \leq b.\)
    Let \(c\) be in \([a, b].\)
    <ul>
        <li>
            \(f(c)\) is the <span class="emph">absolute maximum</span> value of \(f\) 
            if \(f(c) \geq f(x)\) for all \(a \leq x \leq b.\) 
        </li>
        <li>
            \(f(c)\) is the <span class="emph">absolute minimum</span> value of \(f\) 
            if \(f(c) \leq f(x)\) for all \(a \leq x \leq b.\) 
        </li>
    </ul>
    We may also call \(f(c)\) the <i>global</i> maximum or <i>global</i> minimum, respectively.

    Consider \(f(x)\) for \(a \leq x \leq b.\) Suppose \(c\) is in \([a, b].\) 
    <ul>
        <li>
            \(f(c)\) is the <span class="emph">absolute maximum</span> value of \(f\)

<p>
    As shown by <a href="#min-max-x2">Figure 2</a>, 
    the absolute <i>minimum</i> of \(g(x) = x^2\) is \(g(0) = 0.\) 
    But \(g\) has no maximum because the graph of \(y = x^2\) has no highest value. 
    Similarly, \(h(x) = x^3\) has no extrema, since its graph has no lowest point or highest point
    (<a href="#min-max-x3">Figure 3</a>). 
    Thus, we conclude that a function may not have an absolute minimum or absolute maximum over its entire domain.
    Over a closed interval, however, a continuous function must have both an absolute minimum and absolute maximum.
    This is by the <span class="emph">Extreme Value Theorem</span>.

<!-- extreme value theorem -->
<div class="box-title" id="extreme-value-theorem"> EXTREME VALUE THEOREM </div>
<div class="box">
    If \(f\) is continuous over \([a, b],\) 
    then \(f\) attains an absolute minimum value \(f(c)\) and an absolute maximum value \(f(d),\)
    where \(c\) and \(d\) are in \([a, b].\)
</div>

<p>
    For example, the maximum value of \(g(x) = x^2\) in \(0 \leq x \leq 2\) is \(g(2) = 4,\)
    while the minimum value in this interval is \(g(0) = 0.\)
    Similarly, \(h(x) = x^3\) for \(-1 \leq x \leq 1\) has a maximum of \(h(1) = 1\) and a minimum of \(h(-1) = -1.\)
    In each of these cases, the extrema lie at the <i>endpoints</i> of a closed interval.
    By the Extreme Value Theorem, an extreme value can be attained multiple times.
    For example, the graph of \(y = \sin x\) has infinitely many peaks and 
    troughs—corresponding to the <i>absolute</i> maxima and absolute minima, respectively.
    If \(f\) is uniform, then the minimum value and maximum value are the same. 
    For example, the absolute minimum and absolute maximum of \(g(x) = 5\) are both \(5.\)

<aside class="box-caution">
    The derivative of \(f(x) = 1/x\) is \(f'(x) = -1/x^2,\)
    which is undefined at \(x = 0.\) But since \(f(0)\) is also undefined, 
    \(x = 0\) does <span class="warning">not</span> correspond to a critical point of \(f.\)
</aside> 

<h4 id="critical-points">Critical Points</h4>
<p>
    A function \(f\) has a <span class="emph">critical point</span> when \(x = c\) if   
    \(f'(c) = 0\) or if \(f'(c)\) is undefined and \(f(c)\) is defined. 
    We then call \(c\) a <span class="emph">critical number</span> of \(f.\)
    For example, we find the critical numbers of \(g(x) = \frac{1}{3} x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x - 1\)
    by setting \(g'(x) = 0.\) Since \(g\) is a polynomial, its derivative is never undefined. 
    Thus, we find 
    \[
    \ba 
    g'(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 &= 0 \nl 
    (x - 3)(x - 1) &= 0 \comma 
    \ea 
    \] 
    whose solutions are \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3.\)
    So these are the critical numbers of \(g.\)

            Furthermore, \(g'(0)\) is undefined but \(g(0)\) is defined.

    We now discuss how to find the 
    <i>relative minima</i> and <i>relative maxima</i> of a function \(f.\)
    (These terms are also called <i>local extrema</i>.)  
    Graphically, these points represent troughs and peaks, respectively, of the graph of \(y = f(x).\) 
    In <a href="#min-max-deriv-sign-change">Figure 4</a>, 
    Point \(A\) is the location of a relative minimum of \(f,\)
    whereas Point \(B\) is the location of a relative maximum of \(f.\)
</p>
<p>
    Points \(A\) and \(B\) are both critical points because \(f' = 0\) at each point.
    At Point \(A\) the sign of \(f'\) flips from negative to positive.
    Conversely, at Point \(B,\) \(f'\) changes sign from positive to negative.
    We then see the following: If \(x = c\) is a critical number of \(f(x),\) then
    <ul>
        <li>
            \(f\) has a <span class="emph">relative minimum</span> at \(c\) if 
            \(f'\) changes sign from negative to positive at \(c.\)
        </li>
        <li>
            \(f\) has a <span class="emph">relative maximum</span> at \(c\) if 
            \(f'\) changes sign from positive to negative at \(c.\)
        </li>
        <li>
            \(f\) has neither a relative minimum nor relative maximum at \(c\) if 
            \(f'\) does not change sign at \(c.\)
        </li>
    </ul>
    We call these guidelines the <span class="emph">First Derivative Test</span>.
    For example, the derivative of \(g(x) = x^3\) is \(g'(x) = 3x^2,\) satisfying \(g'(0) = 0.\) 
    Therefore, \(x = 0\) is a critical number of \(g.\)
    But \(g'(x) = 3x^2 \geq 0,\) so \(g'\) does not change sign at \(x = 0.\)
    Hence, \(x = 0\) is <i>not</i> a relative extremum of \(g\) (see <a href="#min-max-x3">Figure 3</a>).

        Additionally, the values of \(g\) at the endpoints of \([-2, 4]\) are 
        \[g(-2) = -2 \and g(4) = 16 \pd\] 
        The smallest of these values is \(g(2) = -10,\) and the largest is \(g(4) = 16.\)
        Thus, the <span class="emph">minimum value</span> of \(g\) in \([-2, 4]\) is \(-10,\)
        and the <span class="emph">maximum value</span> is \(16.\)

        A function \(f\) may have two types of extrema: absolute extrema and relative extrema. 
        Consider \(f(x)\) for \(a \leq x \leq b.\) Suppose \(c\) is in \([a, b].\) 
        We call \(f(c)\) the <span class="emph">absolute maximum</span> value of \(f\) 
        if \(f(c) \geq f(x)\) for all \(a \leq x \leq b.\) 
        In contrast, \(f(c)\) is the <span class="emph">absolute minimum</span> value of \(f\) 
        if \(f(c) \leq f(x)\) for all \(a \leq x \leq b.\) 
    </p>
    <p>
        The <span class="emph">Extreme Value Theorem</span>
        states the following: if \(f\) is continuous over \([a, b],\) 
        then \(f\) attains an absolute minimum value \(f(c)\) and an absolute maximum value \(f(d),\)
        where \(c\) and \(d\) are in \([a, b].\)

        A function \(f(x)\) has a <span class="emph">critical point</span> at \(c\) 
        if \(f'(c) = 0\) or if \(f'(c)\) is undefined and \(f(c)\) is defined. 
        Then \(x = c\) is called a <span class="emph">critical number</span> of \(f(x).\)

        The <span class="emph">First Derivative Test</span> states the following: 
        If \(c\) is a critical number of \(f,\) then 
        <ol class="list-alpha">
            <li>
                \(f\) has a <span class="emph">relative minimum</span> at \(c\) if 
                \(f'\) changes sign from negative to positive at \(c.\)
            </li>
            <li>
                \(f\) has a <span class="emph">relative maximum</span> at \(c\) if 
                \(f'\) changes sign from positive to negative at \(c.\)
            </li>
            <li>
                \(f\) has neither a relative minimum nor relative maximum at \(c\) if 
                \(f'\) does <i>not</i> change sign at \(c.\)

        We use the <span class="emph">Closed Interval Method</span>
        to determine the absolute minimum and absolute maximum of a function \(f\) over a closed interval \([a, b].\)
        The procedure is as follows. 
        <ol class="list-num">
            <li>
                Evaluate \(f\) at the critical numbers in \((a, b).\) 
            </li>
            <li>
                Evaluate \(f\) at the endpoints \(a\) and \(b.\)
            </li>
            <li>
                Determine the smallest and largest of the values in Steps 1 and 2.
                The largest value is the absolute maximum of \(f,\) 
                while the smallest value is the absolute minimum of \(f.\)
            </li>
