        \(f(x) = x^3 - 12x\)
    </div>
    <span>
        The function \(f\) has a critical point at \(c\) 
        if either \(f'(c) = 0\) or \(f'(c)\) is undefined and \(f(c)\) is defined. 
        Since \(f(x)\) is a polynomial, it is continuous and differentiable for all \(x.\) 
        Therefore, \(f'(x)\) is never undefined; instead, we need \(f'(x) = 0.\)
        Solving, we find   
        \[
        \ba 
        f'(x) = 3x^2 - 12 &= 0 \nl 
        3(x + 2)(x - 2) &= 0 \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        The solutions are \(x = -2\) and \(x = 2,\)
        so these are the critical numbers of \(f.\)

    <div>
        \(\ds f(x) = \frac{1}{3} x^3 - 2x^2 - 5x + 4\)
    </div>
    <span>
        Solving \(f'(x) = 0,\) we find   
        \[
        \ba 
        f'(x) = x^2 - 4x - 5 &= 0 \nl 
        (x - 5)(x + 1) &= 0 \comma 
        \ea 
        \]
        whose solutions are \(x = -1\) and \(x = 5.\)
        So these are the critical numbers of \(f.\)
    </span>

    <div>
        \(\ds f(t) = \frac{1}{t - 2}\)
    </div>
    <span>
        We differentiate to find 
        \[f'(t) = -\frac{1}{(t - 2)^2} \pd\]
        Note that \(f'(2)\) is undefined. 
        But because \(f(2)\) is also undefined, \(t = 2\) is not a critical number of \(f(t).\)
        And no solutions exist to \(f'(t) = 0,\)
        so we conclude that \(f(t)\) has <u>no critical numbers</u>.

    <div>
        \(\ds g(x) = \frac{1}{4} x^4 - \frac{4}{3} x^3 + 6x^2 - 48x + 12\)
    </div>
    <span>
        Because \(g\) is a polynomial, it is continuous and differentiable for all real numbers.
        Therefore, \(g'\) is never undefined. 
        Instead, we need \(g'(x) = 0.\)
        Differentiating and solving give 
        \[
        \ba 
        g'(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 12x - 48 &= 0 \nl 
        x^2(x - 4) + 12(x - 4) &= 0 \nl 
        (x^2 + 12)(x - 4) &= 0 \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        The only solution is \(x = 4,\) the sole critical number of \(g.\)
    </span>

    <div>
        \(\ds f(t) = \frac{2}{3} t^3 - 3t^2 - 8t + 4\)
    </div>
    <span>
        Solving \(f'(t) = 0,\) we find 
        \[
        \ba 
        f'(t) = 2t^2 - 6t - 8 &= 0 \nl 
        2(t - 4)(t + 1) &= 0 \comma 
        \ea 
        \]
        whose solutions are \(t = -1\) and \(t = 4.\)
        Thus, these are the critical numbers of \(f.\)

        \(\ds f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x - 2} \, (x + 3)\)
    </div>
    <span>
        Differentiating, we find 
        \[f'(x) = \frac{x + 3}{3(x - 2)^{2/3}} + \sqrt[3]{x - 2}\pd\]
        Note that \(f'(2)\) is undefined but \(f(2)\) is defined. 
        Also, the solution to \(f'(x) = 0\) is \(x = 3/4.\)
        Therefore, the critical numbers of \(f(x)\) are \(x = 3/4\) and \(x = 2.\) 
    </span>

    <div>
        \(\ds p(x) = x^{1/3} - x^{1/5}\)
    </div>
    <span>
        We differentiate to obtain 
        \[p'(x) = \frac{1}{3 x^{2/3}} - \frac{1}{5x^{4/5}} \pd\]
        Because \(p'(0)\) is undefined and \(p(0)\) <i>is</i> defined, 
        \(x = 0\) is a critical number of \(p(x).\)
        Since \(p'(x)\) is defined for all \(x \ne 0\) and \(p'(x) = 0\) 
        has no solutions, we conclude that \(x = 0\) is the only critical number of \(p(x).\)
    </span>

        \(\ds y = x \ln x\)
    </div>
    <span>
        Differentiating, we find  
        \[y' = \ln x + 1 \pd\]
        We want to solve \(y' = 0\) or find where \(y'\) is undefined.
        For the former case, we get 
        \[
        \ba 
        \ln x + 1 &= 0 \nl 
        x &= e^{-1} = 1/e \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        For the latter case, we understand that \(y'\) is undefined for all \(x \lt 0.\)
        But these values are not in the domain of \(y = x \ln x,\) 
        so \(x = 1/e\) is the only critical number of \(y.\)

        \(\ds h(x) = xe^x\)

        We differentiate to get 
        \[h'(x) = xe^x + e^x \pd\]
        Solving \(h'(x) = 0,\) we find 
        \[
        \ba 
        xe^x + e^x &= 0 \nl 
        e^x (x + 1) &= 0 \nl 
        x &= -1 \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        Since \(h'(x)\) is defined for all \(x,\) 
        \(x = -1\) is the only critical number of \(h.\)

        The graph of \(y = \abs{3x -5}\) is a V-shaped graph has a zero at \(x = 5/3.\)
        At \(x = 5/3\) the graph has a cusp, 
        so \(f'(5/3)\) does not exist. 
        Hence, \(x = 5/3\) is a critical number of \(f.\)

        Differentiating, we find

        The only critical number of \(f\) is \(x = 1\)
        because \(f'(1) = 0.\)
        At \(x = 1,\) we analyze the sign change of \(f' \col\)
        For \(x \lt 1,\) \(f' \lt 0;\) for \(x \gt 1,\) \(f' \gt 1.\)
        Because \(f'\) changes sign from negative to positive at \(x = 1,\)

        whose zeros are \(x = -7\) and \(x = -1.\)
        These are the critical numbers of \(f.\)
        We now analyze sign changes:
        When \(x \lt -7,\) \(f' \gt 0;\)
        when \(-7 \lt x \lt -1,\) \(f' \lt 0.\)
        Since \(f'\) changes sign from positive to negative at \(-7,\)
        the First Derivative Test states that \(f(x)\) has a relative maximum at \(x = -7.\)
        Likewise, \(f' \gt 0\) for \(x \gt -1,\) 
        so \(f'\) changes sign from negative to positive at \(-1.\)
        Accordingly, \(f(x)\) has a relative minimum at \(x = -1.\)

        We get 
        \[f'(x) = \frac{1}{x^2} \par{1 - \ln x} \pd\]
        The solution to \(f'(x) = 0\) is \(x = e,\) 
        the only critical number of \(f.\)
        For \(0 \lt x \lt e,\) \(f' \gt 0;\)
        for \(x \gt e,\) \(f' \lt 0.\)

    </div>
    <span>
        The Closed Interval Method requires us to evaluate the function at the endpoints of \([-3, 3]\) 
        and at the critical numbers of \(f\) in \((-3, 3).\)
        We find the critical numbers by solving \(f'(x) = 0 \col\)
        \[
        \ba 
        f'(x) = x^2 - 4 &= 0 \nl
        (x + 2)(x - 2) &= 0 \nl 
        x &= -2 \cma x = 2 \pd   
        \ea 
        \]
        Evaluating \(f\) at the endpoints, we find 
        \[f(-3) = 7 \and f(3) = 1 \pd\]
        At the critical numbers, \(x = -2\) and \(x = 2,\) we get 
        \[f(-2) = \tfrac{28}{3} \and f(2) = -\tfrac{4}{3} \pd\]
        The greatest of these values is \(28/3,\) and the lowest is \(-4/3.\)
        Thus, those values are the absolute maximum and absolute minimum, respectively, of \(f\) on \([-3, 3].\)

        \(\ds g(x) = x^2 \ln x \cma 0 \leq x \leq 1\)
    </div>
    <span>
        Using the Closed Interval Method, we evaluate \(g\) at the endpoints of \([0, 1]\)
        and at the critical numbers in \((0, 1).\)
        We find the critical numbers by solving \(g'(x) = 0 \col\)
        \[
        \ba 
        g'(x) = 2x \ln x + x &= 0 \nl 
        2 \ln x &= -1 \nl 
        x &= e^{-1/2} \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        At the endpoints of \([0, 1],\)  
        \[g(0) = 0 \and g(1) = 0 \pd\]
        And at the critical number \(e^{-1/2},\) 
        \[g \par{e^{-1/2}} = e^{-1} \ln \par{e^{-1/2}} = \frac{-1}{2e} \pd \]
        The smallest of these values is \(-1/2e,\) so this value is the absolute minimum of \(g\) on \([0, 1].\)
        Likewise, the largest value is \(0,\) the absolute maximum of \(g\) on the interval.

    </div>
    <span>
        The function \(f\) must have absolute extrema at either the endpoints of \([-6, 3]\)
        or at any critical numbers within. 
        At the endpoints, we have 
        \[f(-6) = \tfrac{1}{4} \and f(3) = 1 \pd\]
        We find critical points by considering
        \[f'(x) = \frac{-2}{3(x - 2)^{5/2}} \cma\]
        which is undefined at \(x = 2.\)
        But since \(f(2)\) is also undefined, \(x = 2\) is not a critical number of \(f.\)
        Moreover, the graph of \(y = f(x)\) has a vertical asymptote at \(x = 2\) 
        and approaches \(\infty\) from both sides, because  
        \(\lim_{x \to 2^-} f(x) = \infty\) and \(\lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x) = \infty.\)
        We then conclude that \(f\) has no absolute maximum on \([-6, 3],\)
        whereas the absolute minimum on the interval is \(1/4.\)

        The absolute extrema of \(g\) must either lie at the endpoints of \([-1, 1]\)
        or at any critical numbers within. 
        We find 
        \[g(-1) = \tfrac{1}{2} \and g(1) = \tfrac{1}{2} \pd\]
        Furthermore, we solve \(g'(t) = 0\) to find the critical numbers of \(g.\)
        We get 
        \[
        \ba 
        g'(t) = \frac{-2t}{(1 + t^2)^2} &= 0 \nl 
        t &= 0 \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        We then obtain \(g(0) = 1.\)
        The smallest of these values is \(1/2,\) the absolute minimum of \(g\) on \([-1, 1].\)
        The largest value is \(1,\) the absolute maximum of \(g\) on the interval.

    </div>
    <span>
        Using the Closed Interval Method, we evaluate \(f\) at the endpoints of \([-1, 1]\) and at the critical numbers within.
        We first find 
        \[f(-1) = \tfrac{\pi}{2} \and f(1) = \tfrac{\pi}{2} \pd\]
        We now let \(f'(u) = 0\) to obtain 
        \[
        \ba 
        f'(u) = \sin^{-1} u + \frac{u}{\sqrt{1 - u^2}} &= 0 \nl 
        \implies u &= 0 \cma 
        \ea 
        \]
        the only critical number of \(f.\) 
        Although \(f'(-1)\) and \(f'(1)\) are undefined, 
        \(u = -1\) and \(u = 1\) are the endpoints of \([-1, 1]\)
        and therefore are not additional critical numbers of \(f.\)
        Nevertheless, 
        \[f(0) = 0 \cma\]
        the absolute minimum of \(f\) on \([-1, 1]\) because \(0\) is the smallest value. 
        Conversely, \(\pi/2\) is the largest value and is therefore the absolute maximum of \(f\) on \([-1, 1].\)

        Let \(g\) be a continuous function on \([-6, 4].\)
        The graph of its derivative, \(y = g'(x),\) is shown by <a href="#min-max-exercise-graph">Figure 7</a>.
        Find all the critical numbers of \(g.\)

        We see \(g' = 0\) when \(x = -5\) and \(x = 3.\)
        Moreover, \(g\) is undefined at \(x = -1.\)
        Therefore, all these values are critical numbers of \(g.\)
        We now analyze sign flips:
        At \(x = -5,\) \(g'\) does not change sign, so \(g\) does not have an extremum at \(x = -5.\)
        Likewise, \(g\) has no extremum at \(x = -1,\) because \(g'\) does not change sign. 
        Conversely, at \(x = 3\) the sign of \(g'\) changes from positive to negative, 
        indicating that \(x = 3\) corresponds to a relative maximum of \(g.\)

    <span>
        We differentiate to get 
        \[f'(x) = 3ax^2 + 4x + c \pd \]
        A critical number of \(f\) satisfies \(f' = 0.\) 
        Because \(f'\) is a quadratic, \(f' = 0\) has two solutions—both of which are critical numbers of \(f.\)
        Solving \(f'(x) = 0\) by the Quadratic Formula, we obtain 
        \[
        \ba 
        x_1 &= \frac{-4 + \sqrt{16 - 12ac}}{6a} \cma \nl
        x_2 &= \frac{-4 - \sqrt{16 - 12ac}}{6a} \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        The sum of these values is 
        \[x_1 + x_2 = \frac{-4}{6a} = \frac{-2}{3a} \pd \]
        Thus, the sum of the critical numbers of \(f\) is \(\frac{-2}{3a}.\)

    </div>
    <span>
        If \(g\) has a relative minimum when \(x = 4,\) 
        then by the First Derivative Test \(g'\) must change sign from negative to positive at \(x = 4.\)
        We must also have \(g'(4) = 0.\) 
        Solving for \(a,\) we get

        For \(a \lt 1/4,\) \(g'(4) \lt 0;\) for \(a \gt 1/4,\) \(g'(4) \gt 0.\)
        This analysis confirms that \(a = 1/4\) allows \(g\) to have a relative minimum when \(x = 4.\)

        It is known that \(f(k) = 0.\)
        Show that \(g(x)\) also has a critical point at \(x = k.\)

    <span>
        The function \(g\) has a critical point at \(x = k\) 
        either if \(g'(k) = 0\) or if \(g'(k)\) is undefined. 
        But because \(g'\) is given to be continuous at \(x = k,\) 
        only the former option is possible.
        Thus, we aim to show that \(g'(k) = 0.\)
        We differentiate \(g\) and plug in \(x = k\) to get 
        \[g'(k) = f(k) + k f'(k) \pd\]
        It is given that \(f(k) = 0.\) 
        Moreover, \(f'\) has a critical point at \(x = k;\) since \(f'\) is continuous at \(x = k,\)
        \(f'(k)\) must be \(0.\)
        Therefore, \(g'(k) = 0,\) so \(x = k\) is a critical number of \(g.\)

        Because \(\sin 90 \degree = 1,\) we obtain the maximum of sine and therefore of \(D.\)

        The number of Tapioca balls in a cylindrical cup of boba is modeled by the function
        \[b(h) = h \sqrt{81 - h^2} \cma \]
        where \(h\) is measured in inches from the top of the cup. 
        At what height is the number of Tapioca balls the largest?
    </div>
    <span>
        Note that the cup is \(9\) inches tall because the domain of \(b(h)\) in context is \(0 \leq h \leq 9.\)
        The absolute <i>minimum</i> of \(b\) is obtained at the endpoints
        because \(b(0) = b(9) = 0.\)
        We now locate the critical numbers of \(b\) by letting \(b'(h) = 0 \col \)
        \[
        \ba 
        b'(h) = \frac{81 - 2h^2}{\sqrt{81 - h^2}} &= 0 \nl 
        \implies h &= \frac{9}{\sqrt{2}} \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        We note the following:
        For \(0 \lt h \lt 9/\sqrt{2},\) \(b' \gt 0;\)
        for \(9/\sqrt{2} \lt h \lt 9,\) \(b' \lt 0.\)
        Thus, \(h = 9/\sqrt{2}\) corresponds to a relative <i>maximum</i> of \(b;\)
        in fact, it corresponds to the <i>absolute</i> maximum. 
        We therefore conclude that the number of Tapioca balls is greatest at a distance of 
        \(9/\sqrt{2} \approx 6.364\) inches from the top of the cup.
