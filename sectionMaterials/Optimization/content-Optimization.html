    Optimization is the process by which a quantity of interest is maximized or minimized. 
    It is a mathematical procedure that applies absolute extrema to real-world problems.
    The emphasis on efficiency in the everyday world cultivates the need for optimization in a wide range of applications, 
    including geometry, finance, and science.
    Examples of optimization problems include maximizing volume, 
    minimizing surface area, minimizing materials used, minimizing time, and maximizing profit.  
    In this section, we explore the strategy to solve these problems and see their diverse uses.

    Often, the most difficult step is understanding the problem and setting up equations. 
    Let's introduce some general problem-solving steps for optimization problems.

        <li>
            <i>Notation.</i> Assign a variable—say, \(Q\)—to the quantity to maximize or minimize.
            Introduce notation by assigning algebraic quantities to unknown values. 
            It is helpful to use suggestive variables, such as \(A\) for area, \(d\) for distance, and \(L\) for length.

        <li>
            <i>Minimize or Maximize.</i> Use calculus 
            to to find the absolute minimum or maximum of \(Q(x).\)  
            Find the critical numbers of \(Q\) and consider the endpoints of the domain in context.

</div>

<p>
    The First Derivative Test and the Second Derivative Test allow us to determine
    whether a critical number corresponds to a <i>relative</i> minimum or maximum. 
    To locate the <i>absolute</i> minimum or maximum,
    first establish the domain of \(Q.\) 
    For example, if \(Q(x)\) represents area, then no side length \(x\) can 
    result in a negative value of \(Q.\) 
    Afterward, consider the endpoints or end behavior of the domain.
    Analyze extreme cases: 
    What happens to \(Q(x)\) if \(x\) is made as small as possible?
    What happens if \(x\) is made as large as possible?

        To understand the problem, we experiment with some possibilities: 
        <ul>
            <li>
                If \(a = 13\) and \(b = 1,\) then their product is \(P = 13.\)
            </li>
            <li>
                If \(a = 12\) and \(b = 2,\) then their product is \(P = 24.\)
            </li>
            <li>
                If \(a = 11\) and \(b = 3,\) then their product is \(P = 33.\)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        We want to find \(a\) and \(b\) that maximize the product \(P = ab\) 
        and adhere to the condition \(a + b = 14.\) 
        Since \(a\) and \(b\) add to \(14,\)
        \begin{equation}
            a + b = 14 \pd \label{eq:product-step-1}
        \end{equation}
        We want to <i>maximize</i>
        \begin{equation}
            P = ab \pd \label{eq:product-step-2}
        \end{equation}
        Our goal is to express \(P\) in terms of one variable—for example, \(a.\)
        From \(\eqRefer{eq:product-step-1},\) we find \(b = 14 - a.\)
        We substitute this expression into \(\eqRefer{eq:product-step-2}\) 
        to get 
        \[P = a(14 - a) = 14a - a^2 \pd\]
        We may now write \(P\) as \(P(a).\) 
        We find the critical numbers of \(P(a)\) by solving \(P'(a) = 0 \col\) 
        \[
        \ba 
        P'(a) = 14 - 2a &= 0 \nl
        \implies a &= 7 \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        For \(a \lt 7,\) \(P' \gt 0;\) 
        for \(a \gt 7,\) \(P' \lt 0.\)
        Since \(P'(a)\) changes sign from positive to negative at \(a = 7,\) 
        the First Derivative Test states that \(a = 7\) is the location of a <i>relative</i> maximum of \(P.\)
        Also note the following:
        <ul>
            <li>
                If \(a \lt 0,\) then \(b \gt 0\) and \(P \lt 0.\) 
            </li>
            <li>
                If \(a \gt 14,\) then \(b \lt 0\) and \(P \lt 0.\) 
            </li>
        </ul>
        Thus, \(a = 7\) must also correspond to the <i>absolute</i> maximum of \(P\)
        (see <a href="#optimization-ex-product">Figure 1</a>).
        If \(a = 7,\) then 
        \[b = 14 - 7 = 7\] and \(P = 7 \cdot 7 = 49.\) 
        So \(\boxed{a = 7}\) and \(\boxed{b = 7}\)
        maximize the product \(P.\)

        What dimensions should she make the pen to maximize its area?

            }
        </style>
        We create a sketch of the scenario (<a href="#optimization-ex-farmer-pen">Figure 2</a>).
        Let \(w\) denote the pen's width and \(\ell\) denote the pen's length. 
        Also let \(A\) be the area of the pen. 
        These suggestive variables help us avoid confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Let's construct a system of equations. The equation for the pen's perimeter is 
        \begin{equation}
            2w + \ell = 40 \pd \label{eq:farmer-1}
        \end{equation}
        We want to <i>maximize</i>
        \begin{equation}
            A = w \ell\ \pd \label{eq:farmer-2}
        \end{equation}
    </p>
    <p>
        Rearranging \(\eqRefer{eq:farmer-1}\) yields \(\ell = 40 - 2w,\) 
        which we substitute into \(\eqRefer{eq:farmer-2}\) to acquire
        \[ A = w \ell = w(40 - 2w) \pd\]
        We now have a function of \(A\) composed solely of \(w,\)
        so we may differentiate \(A\) to find its critical numbers: 
        \[ 
        \ba 
        A'(w) = 40 - 4w &= 0 \nl 
        \implies w &= 10 \pd 
        \ea 
        \]

        </style>
        The width must satisfy \(0 \leq w \leq 20;\) otherwise, \(A \lt 0.\) 
        The <i>absolute</i> maximum either of \(A\) lies either at the endpoints of \(0 \leq w \leq 20\) or at its critical numbers.  
        By the First Derivative Test, \(w = 10\) corresponds to a relative maximum of \(A\) since 
        \(A'(w)\) switches sign from positive to negative at \(w = 10.\)
        At \(w = 0\) and \(w = 20,\) \(A = 0\) because the pen collapses into a line. 
        Thus, \(w = 10\) corresponds to the <i>absolute</i> maximum of \(A\) 
        (<a href="#optimization-ex-farmer-graph">Figure 3</a>).   
        For \(w = 10,\) we have \(\ell = 40 - 2(10) = 20.\)
        Thus, a pen of dimensions \(20\) feet by \(10\) feet produces the maximum area, \(200\) square feet.

        To understand the problem, 
        we construct a picture (<a href="#optimization-ex-can-diagram">Figure 4</a>). 
        Let \(r\) be the can's radius and \(h\) be its height.
        The volume of the cylinder is then 
        \begin{equation}
            40 = \pi r^2 h \pd \label{eq:equation-cylinder-volume}
        \end{equation}
        We want to <i>minimize</i> the surface area:
        \begin{equation}
            S = 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r h \pd \label{eq:equation-cylinder-SA}
        \end{equation}
        (To remember this formula, see that the bases of the can are circles of area \(\pi r^2,\) 
        and a rectangular sheet of area \(2 \pi r h\) is wrapped around the can.)
    </p>
    <p>
        We aim to express \(S\) in terms of one variable.
        From \(\eqRefer{eq:equation-cylinder-volume},\) 
        we have \(h = 40/(\pi r^2),\)
        which we plug into \(\eqRefer{eq:equation-cylinder-SA}\) to get 
        \[
        \ba 
        S &= 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r \left(\frac{40}{\pi r^2}\right) \nl
        &= 2 \pi r^2 + \frac{80}{r} \pd 
        \ea 
        \] 
        We solve \(S'(r) = 0,\) as follows:  
        \[
        \ba 
        S'(r) = 4 \pi r - \frac{80}{r^2} &= 0 \nl
        \implies r &= \sqrt[3]{\frac{20}{\pi}} \pd \nl
        \ea 
        \]

        For \(r \lt \sqrt[3]{20/\pi},\) \(S' \lt 0;\) for \(r \gt \sqrt[3]{20/\pi},\) \(S' \gt 0.\)
        Since \(S'\) changes sign from negative to positive at \(r = \sqrt[3]{20/\pi},\) 
        this value corresponds to a <i>relative</i> minimum of \(S\) by the First Derivative Test. 
        Also, because \(\lim_{r \to 0^+} S(r) = \infty\) and \(\lim_{r \to \infty} S(r) = \infty,\)
        there needs to be a minimum value of \(S(r),\) which must exist at the critical number 
        (<a href="#optimization-ex-can-graph">Figure 5</a>).
        So \(r = \sqrt[3]{20/\pi}\) corresponds to the <i>absolute</i> minimum of \(S.\) 
        We then have \(r \approx 1.853 \un{in}\) and
        \[h = \frac{40}{\pi (20/\pi)^{2/3}} \approx 3.707 \un{in} \pd\]
        Thus, a can of radius \(1.853 \un{in}\) and height \(3.707 \un{in}\)
        minimizes the materials used while holding the required volume.
        With a radius of \(1.853 \un{in},\) the cylinder's diameter is \(3.707 \un{in}\)—the
        same dimension as the height. 
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    In some situations, minimizing or maximizing the square of a function is more convenient. 
    If \(f(x)\) has a relative minimum or maximum at \(x = a,\) then so does \(\sqrt{f(x)}.\) 
    For example, 
    \[p(x) = \sqrt{3 + (x - 2)^2} \and q(x) = 3 + (x - 2)^2\]
    each have a relative minimum at \(x = 2.\)
    This fact is convenient because we can choose to optimize the <i>square</i> 
    of a function—a process that is sometimes easier.

        We see \(q'\) changes sign from positive to negative at \(x = 0,\)
        so this value corresponds to a relative <i>maximum</i> of \(q.\) 
        But we want to <i>minimize</i> \(q,\) so we ignore this critical number. 
        Conversely, \(q'\) changes sign from negative to positive at both \(x = -1/\sqrt 2\) and \(x = 1/\sqrt 2.\) 
        So both values are relative <i>minima</i> of \(q.\)
        Because \(\lim_{x \to -\infty} q\) \(= \infty\) and \(\lim_{x \to \infty} q\) \(= \infty,\)  
        the <i>absolute</i> minima of \(q\) (and therefore of \(d\)) 
        must occur when \(x = -1/\sqrt 2\) and \(x = 1/\sqrt 2\) (<a href="#optimization-ex-distance-graph">Figure 7</a>).
        At each value,

        \[\boxed{\par{\frac{-1}{\sqrt 2} \cma \frac{1}{2}}} \and \boxed{\par{\frac{1}{\sqrt 2} \cma \frac{1}{2}}}\]
        are the closest points on \(y = x^2\) to \((0, 1).\)

        The word <i>inscribed</i> means the rectangle has two vertices on the parabola and two vertices on the \(x\)-axis 
        (<a href="#optimization-ex-inscribed-diagram">Figure 8</a>). 
        Since the rectangle has length \(2x\) and height \(y,\) its area is 
        \begin{equation}
            A = 2xy \pd \label{eq:inscribe-area}
        \end{equation}
        But \(y = 9 - x^2,\) so \(\eqRefer{eq:inscribe-area}\) becomes  
        \[A(x) = 2x(9 - x^2) \pd\]
        We solve \(A'(x) = 0,\) finding
        \[
        \ba 
        A'(x) = 18 - 6x^2 &= 0 \nl
        \implies x &= \nspace -\sqrt 3 \cma \sqrt 3 \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        The domain of \(A(x)\) is \(0 \leq x \leq 3,\)
        so we discard \(x = - \sqrt 3.\)
        The value \(x = \sqrt 3\) corresponds to a <i>relative</i> maximum of \(A\) because 
        \(A'\) changes sign from positive to negative at that point.
        At each endpoint, \(A = 0\) since the rectangle collapses into a line.
        Thus, \(x = \sqrt 3\) is the location of the <i>absolute</i> maximum of \(A.\)
        Then \(y = 9 - (\sqrt 3)^2 = 6,\) so \(\eqRefer{eq:inscribe-area}\) gives the maximum area to be 
        \[A = 2(\sqrt 3)(6) = \boxed{12 \sqrt 3}\]

    <span class="emph">Revenue</span>
    is the amount of money a firm earns from sales. 
    Revenue is the product of quantity and price.
    Let \(x\) be the number of units sold.

        Profit is the positive difference between revenue and cost. 
        The revenue function is \(12x\) and the cost function is \(C(x),\) so

        For \(x \lt 56,\) \(P' > 0;\) for \(x \gt 56,\) \(P' \lt 0.\)

        The domain of \(P(x)\) is \(x \geq 0.\)

        This analysis asserts that \(P\) has a maximum value, which must correspond to \(x = 56.\)
        Sydney therefore should sell \(\boxed{56}\) hot dogs to maximize her profit.

        Let \(x\) be the number of dollars the store raises the price of eyeliner pencils. 
        For every \(\$2\) increase in the pencil,
        the price function is \((10 + 2x)\) and the quantity function is \((40 - 4x).\)
        Revenue is the product of quantity and price, so we have
        \[
        \ba

        For \(x \lt 2.5,\) \(R' \gt 0;\) for \(x \gt 2.5,\) \(R' \lt 0.\)

        A lifeguard on the shoreline runs to rescue a drowning swimmer
        located \(20\) feet east of the lifeguard and \(8\) feet from the shoreline.
        The lifeguard can run at \(10\) feet per second and swim at \(6\) feet per second.
        She runs a distance \(x\) before jumping into the water and swimming to the drowning person 
        (<a href="#optimization-ex-lifeguard-diagram">Figure 9</a>).
        At what distance \(x\) should the lifeguard enter the water in order to minimize the time to rescue the swimmer?
    </div>
</div>
<button onclick="toggle8()" class="solution-button"></button>
<div id="solution8" class="solution">
    <p>
        We need to derive an expression for the time, \(t,\) the lifeguard takes to rescue the swimming person.
        The distance she runs is \(x,\) and the distance she swims is \(\sqrt{(20 - x)^2 + 64}.\)
        The relationship between time, distance, and speed is
        \[\textrm{time} = \frac{\textrm{distance}}{\textrm{speed}} \pd\]
        The lifeguard's speed is \(10\) feet per second onshore and \(6\) feet per second in water. 
        Therefore, her time for the first part of the trip, running onshore, is   
        \[t_1 = \frac{x}{10} \pd\]
        Her time for the second part of the trip, swimming, is 
        \[t_2 = \frac{\sqrt{(20 - x)^2 + 64}}{6} \pd\]
        The total time, \(t,\) is the sum of these times:
        \[
        \ba 
        t &= t_1 + t_2 \nl
        &= \frac{x}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{(20 - x)^2 + 64}}{6} \pd
        \ea 
        \]
        This expression is in terms of \(x,\) so we differentiate to locate its critical numbers:
        \[
        \ba 
        t'(x) = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{x - 20}{6 \sqrt{x^2 - 40x + 464}} &= 0 \nl
        \implies x &= 14 \pd

        Since \(t'(x)\) changes sign from negative to positive at \(x = 14,\) 
        this value corresponds to a <i>relative minimum</i> of \(t.\) 
        You may verify that this value also corresponds to the <i>absolute minimum</i> of \(t\) 
        (<a href="#optimization-ex-lifeguard-graph">Figure 10</a>).
        So the lifeguard should run \(\boxed{14 \un{ft}}\) before jumping in the water.

        Let Tower A be the \(10 \un{m}\) tower and Tower B be the \(15 \un{m}\) tower.
        Let \(x\) be the distance from the base of Tower A to the anchor point. 
        The amount of wire needed to connect top of Tower A to the anchor point is then 
        \[w_1 = \sqrt{x^2 + 15^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 225} \pd\]
        Likewise, the amount of wire needed to connect the anchor point to the top of Tower B is  
        \[w_2 = \sqrt{(30 - x)^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{x^2 - 60x + 1000} \pd\] 
        Therefore, the total amount of wire required is 
        \[
        \ba 
        w &= w_1 + w_2 \nl 
        &= \sqrt{x^2 + 225} + \sqrt{x^2 - 60x + 1000} \pd 
        \ea 
        \]
        We differentiate \(w\) and equate it to \(0\) to find  
        \[
        \ba 
        \frac{\dd w}{\dd x} = \frac{x - 30}{\sqrt{x^2 - 60x + 1000}} + \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 225}} &= 0 \nl
        \implies x &= 18 \pd
        \ea 
        \]
        This critical number corresponds to the absolute minimum of \(w.\)
        Thus, the optimal spot to anchor the wires is \(\boxed{18 \un{m}}\) east of Tower A.
