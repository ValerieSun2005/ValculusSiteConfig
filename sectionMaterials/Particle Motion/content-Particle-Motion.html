<p>
    When Isaac Newton invented calculus, he used it to relate motion in physics.
    Calculus holds a key role in representing motionâ€”position, velocity, and acceleration.
    It allows to determine when an object changes direction
    and how much distance an object covers.
    In this section we relate

    using derivatives. 
    We discuss 
    <a class="page-anchor" href="#turning-points">Turning Points</a> and 
    <a class="page-anchor" href="#distance-traveled">Distance Traveled</a>
    using critical points, which we discussed in Section <!--[[[cref.Minimum-and-Maximum-Values]]]-->.

<h4 id="pos-vel-acc">Position, Velocity, and Acceleration</h4>
<p>
    Consider an object traveling in a straight line, modeled by the \(x\)-axis. 
    The object's <span class="emph">position</span> is its location 
    from \(x = 0.\)
    For example, an object that travels \(3\) units to the right of \(x = 0\)
    has <i>position</i> \(x = 3.\)
    An object's <span class="emph">velocity</span> is its speed in a certain direction:
    If the object travels toward the positive direction of the \(x\)-axis, then its velocity is positive;
    if the object travels toward the negative direction, then its velocity is negative. 
    Velocity is the rate at which position changes with respect to time.
    If \(x\) is position, \(v\) is velocity, and \(t\) is time, then 
    \begin{equation} 
    v = \deriv{x}{t} \pd \label{eq:v}
    \end{equation}
