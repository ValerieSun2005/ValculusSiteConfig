<h4>Exponential Models</h4>
<p>
    <span class="emph">Exponential growth</span> is a phenomenon that
    confers very fast growth.
    Numerically, it represents repeated multiplication, 
    which has applications in population growth and continuous compounding. 
    Conversely, in
    <span class="emph">exponential decay</span> a function rapidly shrinks, usually to \(0.\) 
</p>

    The definition of an <i>exponential model</i> is represented by the differential equation 
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{y}{x} = k y \comma  \label{eq:exp-diff-eq}
    \end{equation}
    where \(k\) is a proportionality constant. 
    In exponential <i>growth</i>, \(k \gt 0\) and \(y\) increases (Figure 1); 
    in exponential <i>decay</i>, \(k \lt 0\) and \(y\) decreases (Figure 2).
    \(\eqRefer{eq:exp-diff-eq}\) shows that rate of change of \(y\) is directly proportional to itself,
    meaning that a <i>small</i> \(y\) changes <i>slowly</i> and a <i>large</i> \(y\) changes <i>quickly</i>. 
    Solving for \(y\) in \(\eqRefer{eq:exp-diff-eq}\) using Separation of Variables, 
    we get

    \ln \abs{y} &= kx + C_1 \nl 
    y &= e^{C_1} e^{kx} \comma  
    \ea 
    \]
    where we let \(C = e^{C_1}\) for notational convenience. 
    We now have 
    \[y = Ce^{kx} \period\]
    If \(x = 0,\) then \(e^{kx} = 1\) and so \(C\) is the value of \(y\) at \(x = 0.\)

<!-- <p>
    Species in a population cannot reproduce indefinitely. 
    There is a limit to how many individuals a population can sustain; 
    we call this limit the <span class="emph">carrying capacity</span>. 
    Thus, we need a function that grows exponentially when the population is small 
    but levels off as the population approaches its carrying capacity. 
    Such a representation is an example of a <span class="emph">logistic model</span>.

    The differential equation that defines a logistic model is
    \begin{equation} 
    \deriv{y}{x} = ky \par{1 - \frac{y}{L}} \comma \label{eq:logistic-diff-eq}  
    \end{equation}
    where \(L\) is the carrying capacity.
    The solution to \(\eqRefer{eq:logistic-diff-eq}\) is 
    \begin{equation} 
    y = \frac{L}{1 + Ce^{-kx}} \comma \label{eq:logistic-eq}
    \end{equation}
    whose derivation is at the end of this section.
    Similar to exponential models, 
    <span class="emph">logistic growth</span> occurs if \(k \gt 0\) 
    and 
    <span class="emph">logistic decay</span> occurs if \(k \lt 0.\)

    Logistic <i>growth</i> is highly intuitive:  
    As \(y\) grows, the term \((1 - y/L)\) acts as an <i>inhibitor</i> that brings \(\textDeriv{y}{x}\) to \(0\) as \(y\) approaches \(L.\)
    Therefore, the graph of \(\eqRefer{eq:logistic-eq}\) for \(k \gt 0\) 
    has the horizontal asymptote \(y = L\) because \(\lim_{x \to \infty} y = L;\)
    see Figure 3.
    Conversely, the graph of logistic <i>decay</i> (\(k \lt 0\) in \(\eqRefer{eq:logistic-eq}\)) 
    has the property \(\lim_{x \to -\infty} y = L;\) see Figure 4. 
</p>





    <!-- To find the solution to \(\eqRefer{eq:logistic-diff-eq},\) 
    we rewrite the differential equation as 
    \[
    \ba 
    \deriv{y}{x} &= ky \par{\frac{L - y}{L}} \nl 
    \frac{1}{ky(L - y)} \di y &= \frac{1}{L} \di x \nl 
    \par{\frac{A}{ky} + \frac{B}{L - y}} \di y &= \frac{1}{L} \di x \period
    \ea  
    \]
    After breaking \(\frac{1}{ky(L - y)}\) into the partial fractions \(A/ky\) and \(B/(L - y),\)
    we solve for \(A\) and \(B\) by finding 
    \[
    \ba 
    \frac{A}{ky} + \frac{B}{L - y} &= \frac{1}{ky(L - y)} \nl 
    \frac{A(L - y) - Bky}{ky(L - y)} &= \frac{1}{ky(L - y)} \nl 
    A(L - y) - Bky &= 1 \period
    \ea 
    \]
    We let \(y = 0\) to find 
    \[A(L - 0) - Bk \cdot 0 = 1 \implies A = \frac{1}{L} \period \]
    Similarly, we assign \(y = L\) to get 
    \[A \cdot 0 - BkL = 1 \implies B = -\frac{1}{kL} \period\] -->
