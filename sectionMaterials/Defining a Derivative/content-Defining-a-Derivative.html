    When you drive a car, the speedometer tells you your <i>instantaneous</i> speed—your 
    change in position at an exact moment. 
    A <span class="emph">derivative</span> is the tool we use in calculus to model this behavior. 
    We might define a derivative as measuring a function's <i>sensitivity to change</i> at a certain moment. 
    In this section we introduce a derivative and construct tangent lines.

    The graph of a function \(f\) is shown in Figure 1. 
    A line intersects the graph of \(y = f(x)\) at the point \(P(x, f(x)).\)
    We call this line a <span class="emph">tangent line</span> to \(y = f(x)\) at \(P.\)
    Loosely speaking, a tangent line "just touches" a curve at a given point. 
    We can't say the tangent line only touches the graph at \(P,\) however,
    because the line could strike the curve anywhere farther away.

    The slope of a tangent line is called the <span class="emph">derivative</span>.
    We calculate the derivative of \(f\) at \(x\) by constructing a <span class="emph">secant line</span>—a line that 
    intersects the graph of \(y = f(x)\) at \(P\) and another nearby point \(Q;\)
    see Figure 2.
    If the horizontal distance between \(P\) and \(Q\) is \(h,\) 
    then the vertical distance is \(f(x + h) - f(x).\)
    Therefore, the slope of the secant line is 
    \[m_{PQ} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \period\]
</p>
<p>
    If \(Q\) is made closer to \(P\)—that is, \(h\) is smaller—then the secant line better resembles the tangent line \(P.\)
    If \(h\) is <i>infinitely</i> close to \(0,\) 
    then the secant line collapses into a tangent line; see Animation 1.
    Therefore, we find the slope of the tangent line by taking the <i>limit</i> of \(m_{PQ}\) as \(h \to 0.\)
    We denote a derivative as either \(\deriv{y}{x}\) or \(f'(x).\)
    Thus, 
    \begin{equation} 
    f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \period \label{eq:lim-defn}  
    \end{equation}

    We can also write 
    \[\deriv{y}{x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \period\]
    Loosely speaking, \(\dd x\) can be thought of as an infinitely small \(\Delta x,\) 
    and \(\dd y\) is similar to an infinitely small \(\Delta y.\)
    We call these terms <span class="emph">differentials</span>. 
    Thus, \(\deriv{y}{x}\) is, roughly speaking, the slope composed of these differentials.
