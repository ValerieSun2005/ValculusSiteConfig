    In this section we review how to identify the features of quadratics, 
    express quadratics in different forms, and
    solve quadratic equations and inequalities.
</p>
<p>
    A quadratic is a second-degree polynomial that when graphed 
    produces a 
    <span class="emph">parabola</span>:
    a symmetrical, U-shaped curve.
    A quadratic expression can be written in <i>standard form</i>, <i>vertex form</i>, or <i>intercept form</i>.
    The standard form of a quadratic is 
    \[ax^2 + bx + c \comma \]
    where \(a\) is called the <i>leading coefficient</i> and \((0, c)\) is the <i>\(y\)-intercept</i>, 
    the point at which the graph of \(y = f(x)\) crosses the \(y\)-axis (Figure 1).
    <figure class="fig-1">
        <img src="../images/Calculus/0/0.1/0.1-1.jpg" class="fig-1__image" alt="">
    </figure>
</p>
<p>
    The vertex form is 
    <div class="numbered-equations">
        <p>
            \(\ds f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k,\)
            <span> \((2)\) </span>
        </p>
    </div>
    where \((h, k)\) is the <i>vertex</i>—the maximum or minimum—of the parabola.
    The vertical line \(x = h,\) called the <i>axis of symmetry</i>, 
    is the line to which the graph of \(y = f(x)\) is symmetrical.
    Note that, for any of these three forms, if \(a\) is negative (as shown by Figure 2), 
    then the parabola opens downward and the vertex is a maximum. 
    Conversely, if \(a\) is positive, then the parabola opens upward and the vertex is a minimum.
</p>
<!--figure 2-->
<div class="fig-2">
    <img src="../images/Calculus/0/0.1/0.1-2.jpg" class="fig-2__image" alt="">
</div>
<p>
    Additionally, the vertex may be calculated from standard form 
    by utilizing the property that the \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex, \(h,\) is given by \(h = \frac{-b}{2a}.\) 
    It then follows that the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex, \(k,\) is \(f(\frac{-b}{2a}).\)
    For example, the vertex of 
    \[x^2 - 2x + 8\]
    has \(x\)-coordinate 
    \[
    \ba 
    h = \frac{-b}{2a} &= \frac{-(-2)}{2(1)} \\
    &= 1.
    \ea 
    \]
    It then follows that its \(y\)-coordinate is 
    \[k = (1)^2 - 2(1) + 8 = 7.\]
    Thus, the quadratic has a vertex of \((1 , 7).\)
</p>
<br>
<p>
    The intercept form is 
    <div class="numbered-equations">
        <p>
            \(\ds f(x) = a(x - p)(x - q),\)
            <span> \((3)\) </span>
        </p>
    </div>
    where \(p\) and \(q\) are zeros of \(y = f(x).\) (See Figure 3.)

<p>
    Vertex form may also be obtained from standard form by <i>completing the square</i>. 
    Consider, as an example, the quadratic expression 
    \[y = 3x^2 - 9x + 2.\]
    Factoring out the leading coefficient, \(3,\) we obtain 
    \[y = 3 \left(x^2 - 3x + \frac{2}{3}\right).\]
    In the parentheses, we can insert the term \(9/4,\)
    which is the square of half of \(-3;\) that is, \((-3/2)^2 = 9/4.\)
    However, we must also subtract it to maintain the equality of the expression:
    \[3 \left(x^2 - 3x + \underline{\frac{9}{4}} - \underline{\frac{9}{4}} + \frac{2}{3} \right).\]
    The term \(x^2 - 3x + 9/4\) creates the perfect square \((x - 3/2)^2,\) 
    so we have 
    \[
    \ba 
    3 \left[\left(x - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{9}{4} + \frac{2}{3} \right] 
    &= 3 \left[\left(x - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{19}{12} \right] \\
    &= \boxed{3 \left(x - \frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - \frac{19}{4}.}  
    \ea 
    \] 
    The strategic insertion of the square of half the coefficient of the 
    \(x\)-term, or \(9/4,\) forces the expression into a perfect square that corresponds to vertex form. 
    Completing the square is an alternative method of determining the vertex of a quadratic presented in standard form. 
    Rewriting a standard-form quadratic into vertex form will also enable us, in some situations, 
    to better utilize methods of calculus.

                There is no leading coefficient to factor out, 
                so we can immediately analyze the coefficient of the \(x\)-term,
                \(-5.\) 
                We need to insert \((-5/2)^2 = 25/4\) into the expression to force the existence of the perfect square

            <!--(ii)-->

                We must first factor out the leading coefficient, \(3,\) to get 
                \[3 \left(x^2 - \frac{7}{3} x + \frac{5}{3}\right).\]
                The coefficient of the \(x\)-term is \(-7/3.\) 
                Half of the coefficient is \(-7/6,\) whose square is \(49/36.\) 
                Thus, we need to insert this quantity into the parentheses to create the perfect square 
                \(\left(x - \frac{7}{6} \right)^2.\)
                \[

                &= 3 \left(x - \frac{7}{6} \right)^2 + 3 \left(\frac{5}{3} - \frac{49}{36} \right) \\ 
                &= \boxed{3 \left(x - \frac{7}{6} \right)^2 + \frac{11}{12}.}

                The coefficient of the linear term is \(4,\)

    To find the zeros of a quadratic equation, we can either factor, complete the square, or use the <i>quadratic formula</i>.
    For the quadratic equation \[ax^2 + bx + c = 0,\] where \(a \ne 0,\) the quadratic formula states that 
    \[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.\]
    A quadratic may have two, one, or no zeros, depending on the sign of the <i>discriminant</i>.
    The discriminant, \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac,\) is the expression in the square root of the quadratic formula. 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        If \(\Delta \gt 0,\) then the quadratic has two real zeros.
    </li>
    <li>
        If \(\Delta = 0,\) then the quadratic has one real zero.
    </li>
    <li>
        If \(\Delta \lt 0,\) then the quadratic has no real zeros.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    These facts should be intuitive because if \(\Delta \lt 0,\) then
    the quadratic formula produces a negative square root, which is undefined. 
    (These cases produce imaginary solutions, but in calculus we only work with real numbers.
    They are outside of our scope for now.)
    Similarly, if \(\Delta = 0,\) then the quantity to which the \(\pm\) sign applies is \(0,\)
    so the only solution is \(x = \frac{-b}{2a}.\) 
    Lastly, if \(\Delta \gt 0,\) then there exists a real quantity from the square root: 
    One solution has the quantity added \(\Big(x = \frac{-b + \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}\)\(\Big),\) 
    and the other has it subtracted \(\Big(x = \frac{-b - \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}\)\(\Big)\).

    Consider Figure 4, in which three parabolas are shown: \(A,\) \(B,\) and \(C.\)
    Parabola \(A\) has a positive discriminant because it has two zeros, while
    parabola \(B\) has a discriminant equal to \(0\) because its graph only has one \(x\)-intercept.  
    Conversely, parabola \(C\) never touches the \(x\)-axis, so its discriminant is negative.

                We can factor the equation by identifying two numbers that multiply to \(3\) 
                and add to \(-4.\) They are \(-1\) and \(-3,\) so we have 
                \[(x - 1)(x - 3) = 0.\]
                By the zero-product property of multiplication, 
                if one of these factors equals \(0,\) then the entire product \((x - 1)(x - 3)\) equals \(0.\)
                \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\) each causes one factor—and, thus, the entire expression—to equal zero.

                It is easiest to solve quadratic equations with all the terms on one side,

                Dividing everything by \(2,\) we get

                The expression \(x^2 - 2x + 2\) cannot be factored,
                so we must instead resort to either completing the square or using the quadratic formula.
                There is no leading coefficient, 
                so completing the square is likely the simplest method. 
                The coefficient of the \(x\)-term is \(-2;\) 
                therefore, we can insert the term \((-2/2)^2 = 1 \! :\)
                \[
                \ba 
                \underbrace{x^2 - 2x + \underline{1}}_{(x - 1)^2} - \underline{1} + 2 &= 0 \\
                (x - 1)^2 + 1 &= 0 \\
                (x - 1)^2 &= -1. 
                \ea 
                \]
                Note that the term \((x - 1)^2\) is never negative because a term squared is always positive or zero. 
                Likewise, if we take the square root of both sides,
                we get 
                \[|x - 1| = \sqrt{-1},\]
                where \(\sqrt{-1}\) is a nonreal quantity. 
                Thus, this equation has no solution.
                The discriminant for this expression is 
                \[\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4(1)(2) = -4,\]
                which is negative. 
                Since a negative discriminant implies that a quadratic has no zeros, this result is affirmed.

                For \(3x^2 - 5x - 7 = 0,\)
                the leading coefficient of \(3\) and uneven numbers make it inconvenient to complete the square,
                as we did in part (iv). Instead, we will use the quadratic formula:
                \[ 
                \ba 
                x &= \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4(3)(-7)}}{2(3)} \\
                &= \boxed{\frac{5 \pm \sqrt{109}}{6}.}
                \ea 
                \]
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>

<p>
    Let us now discuss quadratic inequalities. 
    Consider, as an example, the inequality 
    \[x^2 - 5x + 6 \gt 0.\]
    Factoring, we get 
    \[(x - 3)(x - 2) \gt 0.\]
    We need the factors \((x - 3)\) and \((x - 2)\) to both be positive or both be negative, so we have
    \[
    \ba 
    (x - 3) \gt 0 \quad &\textrm{and} \quad (x - 2) \gt 0 \\ 
    x \gt 3 \quad &\textrm{and} \quad \hspace{5.7ex} x \gt 2,
    \ea 
    \]
    and 
    \[
    \ba 
    (x - 3) \lt 0 \quad &\textrm{and} \quad (x - 2) \lt 0 \\ 
    x \lt 3 \quad &\textrm{and} \quad \hspace{5.7ex} x \lt 2.
    \ea 
    \]
    Therefore, for \(\boxed{x \lt 2}\) and \(\boxed{x \gt 3,}\) 
    the product \((x - 3)(x - 2) \gt 0.\)
    Alternatively, a shortcut is to consider two intervals:
    \(x\) between the zeros or \(x\) outside of this interval.
    That is, we have either \(2 \lt x \lt 3\) or \(x \lt 2, x \gt 3.\)
    To conveniently determine the correct interval, we can plug \(0\) into the quadratic expression:
    \[0^2 - 5(0) + 6 \gt 0,\]
    which is a true inequality. 
    \(0\) is included in the interval \(x \lt 2, x \gt 3,\) so it satisfies the inequality.
