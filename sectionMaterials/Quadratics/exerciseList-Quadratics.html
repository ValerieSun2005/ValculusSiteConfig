        \(x^2 + 6x + 9 = 0\)
    </div>
    <span>
        We factor the quadratic into 
        \[ x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2 \comma \]
        which is \(0\) when \(\boxed{x = -3.}\)
    </span>

    <div>
        \(3x^2 + 7x = 13\)
    </div>
    <span>
        We rewrite the equation in standard form:
        \[3x^2 + 7x - 13 = 0 \comma \]
        Since we can't factor this expression,
        we use the quadratic formula to find the zeros.
        We see \(a = 3,\) \(b = 7,\) and \(c = -13.\)
        Thus,
        \[
        \ba 
        x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} &= \frac{-(7) \pm \sqrt{(7)^2 - 4(3)(-13)}}{2(3)} \nl 
        &= \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{205}}{6} \period 
        \ea 
        \]
        Therefore, the solutions are 
        \[x = \boxed{\frac{-7 + \sqrt{205}}{6} \and \frac{-7 - \sqrt{205}}{6}} \]

    <div>
        \(-5x^2 + 12x = 2x - 4\)
    </div>
    <span>
        We rewrite the equation in standard form:
        \[-5x^2 + 12x = 2x - 4 \implies -5x^2 + 10x + 4 = 0 \comma \]
        We can't factor this expression, so we instead use the quadratic formula.
        We have \(a = -5,\) \(b = 10,\) and \(c = 4.\)
        So 
        \[
        \ba 
        x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} &= \frac{-(10) \pm \sqrt{(10)^2 - 4(-5)(4)}}{2(-5)} \nl 
        &= \frac{10 \pm \sqrt{180}}{10} \nl 
        &= 1 \pm \frac{3 \sqrt{5}}{5} \nl 
        &= \boxed{\frac{1 + 3\sqrt{5}}{5} \and \frac{1 - 3\sqrt{5}}{5}} 
        \ea 
        \]

        How many real zeros does the function \(g(x) = 4x^2 + 3x + 12\) have?
    </div>
    <span>
        Let 
        \[\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \period \] 
        Recall from the section notes that if \(\Delta \gt 0,\) 
        then \(g(x) = 0\) has two real solutions.
        If \(\Delta = 0\), then \(g(x) = 0\) has only one real solution. 
        If \(\Delta \lt 0\), then \(g\) has no zeros.
        Here \(a = 4,\) \(b = 3,\) and \(c = 12.\)
        Then 
        \[\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (3)^2 - 4(4)(12) = -183 \period \]
        Since \(\Delta \lt 0,\) \(g\) has 
        <u>no real zeros</u>.

    <div>
        How many real zeros does the function \(h(x) = -2x^2 + 16x - 5\) have?
    </div>
    <span>
        Let 
        \[\Delta = b^2 - 4ac \period \]
        Here \(a = -2,\) \(b = 16,\) and \(c = -5.\)
        So 
        \[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (6)^2 - 4(-2)(-5) = 216 \period \]
        Since \(\Delta > 0,\) \(h\) has 
        <u>two real zeros</u>.
    </span>

    <div>
        Let \(f(x) = 2x^2 + 5x + c\). Find the value of \(c\) for which \(f\) has only one real zero.
    </div>
    <span>
        The discriminant is 
        \[\Delta = 25 - 8c \period \]
        We know \(f\) has only one real zero if \(\Delta = 0.\)
        Thus, we let \(\Delta = 0:\)
        \[ 25 - 8c = 0 \implies c = \boxed{\frac{25}{8}} \]
    </span>

    <div>
        Let \(g(x) = x^2 + bx + 2\). For what values of \(b\) does \(g\) have no real zeros?
    </div>
    <span>
        The discriminant of \(g\) is 
        \[\Delta = b^2 - 8 \period \]
        The function \(g\) has no real zeros if \(\Delta \lt 0. \)
        Thus, we find the values of \(b\) that satisfies this inequality:
        \[b^2 - 8 \lt 0  \implies  \boxed{-2 \lt b \lt 2} \]

    <div>
        The function \(x^2 - 10x + 8\) is rewritten in the form \((x-p)^2 + q\). Find \(p + q.\)
    </div>
    <span>
        To complete the square, we analyze the coefficient of the \(x\)-termâ€”in this case, \(-10.\) 
        Then we insert the term \((-10/2)^2 = 25\) to allow the quadratic to be rewritten as a perfect square:
        \[
        \ba  
        x^2 - 10x + 8 &= x^2 - 10x + \underline{25} - \underline{25} + 8 \nl 
        &= (x - 5)^2 - 17 \period
        \] 
        Here \(p = 5\) and \(q = -17.\) 
        Thus, \(p + q = \boxed{-12.}\)

    <div>
        Let \(f(x) = -x^2 - 6x + 7.\) Find the \(x\)-coordinate of the maximum point of \(f.\)
    </div>
    <span>
        Because the graph of \(y = f(x)\) is a parabola that opens downward, its 
        vertex represents its maximum point.
        The \(x\)-coordinate of the vertex is 
        \[x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{-6}{2(-1)} = \boxed{-3} \]
    </span>

    <div>
        Find the minimum point of the function \(h(x) = x^2 + 10x - 4.\)
    </div>
    <span>
        Since the graph of \(y = h(x)\) is a parabola that opens upward,
        the vertex represents the minimum point.
        We find the vertex either by noting 
        \[ x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{10}{2(1)} = -5 \period \]
        We now find \(h(-5)\), the \(y\)-coordinate of the vertex:
        \[h(-5) = (-5)^2 + 10(-5) -4 = -29 \period \]
        The minimum point is therefore \(\boxed{(-5, -29).}\)
        An alternative strategy is to complete the square to rewrite \(h(x)\) 
        in vertex form.
