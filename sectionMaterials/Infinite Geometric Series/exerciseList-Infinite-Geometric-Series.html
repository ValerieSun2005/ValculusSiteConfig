        This series has common ratio \(r = 1/2.\) 
        Since \(|r| \lt 1,\) the sum converges.
        The series starts at \(n = 0,\) so the first term is \((1/2)^0 = 1.\)
        So the value of the sum is 
        \[
        \frac{1}{1 - \tfrac{1}{2}} = \boxed{2}
        \]

        \(\ds \sum_{n = 1}^\infty \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^n \) 
    </div>
    <span>
        We find the common ratio to be \(r = 2/3.\)
        The magnitude of \(r\) is less than \(1,\) so the infinite geometric series is convergent. 
        The first term in the sum is \((2/3)^1 = 2/3.\)
        Thus, the sum is 
        \[\frac{2/3}{1 - \tfrac{2}{3}} = \boxed{2}\]

        At first glance, the series does not appear to be geometric.
        But we rewrite the series as 
        \[3 \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \par{\frac{1}{5}}^n \cma \]
        which we easily identify as a geometric series of common ratio \(r = 1/5.\)
        The first term in the series is \(3 \par{\frac{1}{5}}^0 = 3.\)
        Thus, the sum of the series is 
        \[\frac{3}{1 - \tfrac{1}{5}} = \boxed{\frac{15}{4}}\]

    <div>
        \(\ds \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{5^n}{e^{n + 1}} \)
    </div>
    <span>
        We rewrite the series as 
        \[\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{5^n}{e^n \, e} = \frac{1}{e} \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \par{\frac{5}{e}}^n \pd\]
        The common ratio is \(r = 5/3,\) which is greater than \(1.\)
        Therefore, the series <u>diverges</u>.

        We identify the series as geometric with common ratio \(r = 1/5.\)
        The first term is \(3,\) so the sum is

        This series is geometric with common ratio \(r = \pi.\)
        Because \(r \gt 1,\) the series is <u>divergent</u>.

        \(\ds \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{e^{n + 3}}{\pi^n} \)

    <span>
        We rewrite the series as 
        \[\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{e^n \, e^3}{\pi^n} = e^3 \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \par{\frac{e}{\pi}}^n \cma\]
        a geometric series with common ratio \(r = e/\pi.\)
        Note that \(-1 \lt r \lt 1,\) so the series is convergent.
        The first term of the series is \(e^3 \par{\frac{e}{\pi}}^0 = e^3.\)
        Thus, the sum is 
        \[\frac{e^3}{1 - \tfrac{e}{\pi}} = \boxed{\frac{\pi e^3}{\pi - e}}\]

        \(\ds \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{2^{3n - 1}}{7^n} \)

        The series is equivalent to 
        \[\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{2^{3n} \cdot 2^{-1}}{7^n} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{8^n}{7^n} \pd\]
        We identify that the common ratio is \(r = 8/7.\)
        Since \(r \gt 1,\) the series <u>diverges</u>.

        \(\ds \sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{5^{2n}}{e^{n + 1}} \)

        We rewrite the series as 
        \[\sum_{n = 0}^\infty \frac{25^n}{e^n \cdot e} \pd\]
        We see \(r = 25/e,\) which is greater than \(1.\)
        Therefore, the series <u>diverges</u>.

    <span>
        If you find it difficult to identify the common ratio of a known geometric series, 
        then you may divide a term by its preceding term. 
        For example, dividing the second term by the first term shows  
        \[r = \frac{-2e/9}{2/3} = -\frac{e}{3} \pd\]
        The first term is \(2/3,\) so the sum is 
        \[
        \frac{2/3}{1 - \par{-\tfrac{e}{3}}} = \boxed{\frac{2}{3 + e}}

        a geometric series of common ratio \(r = 1/10.\)
        The first term of the series is \(4/10,\) so the sum is

        This series has common ratio \(r = 1/10\) and first term \(3/10,\)

        The decimal \(5.3\) is \(5 + \tfrac{3}{10} = \tfrac{53}{10}.\)
        The repeating decimal \(5.3\overline{2}\) is then

        A bouncy ball is dropped from \(100\) feet.

        What is the total vertical distance the ball travels?

        When the ball is initially dropped, it travels \(100\) feet. 
        On the first rebound, it travels up \(100/3\) feet before falling back down \(100/3\) feetâ€”thus 
        traveling a total distance of \(200/3\) feet. 
        The total distance the ball travels from rebounds is then

        a geometric series of common ratio \(r = 1/3\) and first term \(200/3.\)
        Its sum is therefore

        Suppose that the citizens of a country, on average, spend \(70\) percent of their income and save \(30\) percent.
        Because money changes hands indefinitely, the government can spend \(x\) dollars to generate  
        \[x + 0.7x + (0.7)^2 x + (0.7)^3 x + \cdots\]
        dollars of economic activity.
