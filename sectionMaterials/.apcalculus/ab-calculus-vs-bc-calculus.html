<p>
    CollegeBoard offers two calculus courses:
    AP® Calculus AB and AP® Calculus BC.
    Both courses are equivalent to introductory-level courses in college:
    with passing scores, 
    Calculus AB grants credit for College Calculus I, 
    while Calculus BC grants credit for College Calculus II.
</p>
<h4>AP® Scores</h4>
<p>
    AP exams are scored from 1 to 5. Most colleges grant credit
    for a 3 or higher, 
    but some prestigious schools accept only 4s and 5s.

    lets you search for a college's policy on AP scores.
    In general, you should aim for a 4 or 5 to earn credit for AP Calculus 
    at the majority of colleges.

<h4>Content</h4>
<p>
    Calculus AB is equivalent to a first-semester, introductory college calculus course,
    which covers limits, derivatives, and integrals.
    Calculus BC is equivalent to two semesters of college calculus—it 
    covers limits; derivatives; integrals; infinite series; 
    and calculus of parametric, polar, and vector-valued functions. 
    A high score on Calculus AB exam grants you credit for Calculus I,
    while smashing the Calculus BC exam gives you credit for Calculus I and Calculus II.
    Therefore,
    <u>Calculus BC is the more advanced course</u>.
</p>
<p>
    You can either 
    (1) take AB one year and BC the following year; 
    or (2) take BC immediately, skipping AB.
    Option (2) is the more rigorous option, 
    since you'll be stuffing yourself with more content;
    but Option (1) lets you ease into the transition to BC,
    especially if you aren't confident in your mathematical abilities.
    Some schools don't allow Option (2)—they might require you to complete AB first before tackling on BC.
    But either option adds rigor to your schedule and shows initiative to colleges,
    making your application stand out as competitive.
