                <p class="section-q"> <b>(1) Where do the problems on this site come from? And can I use them?  </b> </p>
                <p class="section-a"> The problems on this site are novel and were written by ya girl herself Valerie :) If you're an instructor who wishes to use my problems for your class, please contact me and we'll discuss it. If you're a student who wishes to use my problems as a supplement, you don't have to ask, because that's their intended purpose!  </p>
                <p class="section-q"> <b>(2) I caught an error or typo in one of your pages; what should I do? </b></p>
                <p class="section-a"> Yeah ... there's bound to be an error somewhere, because there are an algebra, trig, and calculus page — with their own chapters and sections — but only one girl writing them. Please contact me and indicate clearly the location of the error. It'll help a lot if you describe the section number and the erroneous problem. For example, "I caught a typo in your calculus page in section 5.5 (The Disk Method) on example problem 1. The word 'butt' is supposed to be 'but.'" (Trust me, I wouldn't intend on anything anal!)   </p>
                <p class="section-q"> <b>(3) Can you help me with a homework problem? </b></p>
                <p class="section-a"> Unfortunately, no. I only ever work on the website in my free time, so I don't have the availability to be a free tutor 24/7. But I recommend that you head over to this AP Students Discord server for any help — I'm sometimes active on there, and the users on there are very friendly and usually respond to any questions in a few minutes. </p>
                <p class="section-q"> <b>(4) How is the math on this site displayed? </b></p>
                <p class="section-a"> I use MathJax! For the graphs, I usually take a screenshot of Desmos and either photoshop it or use PowerPoint to add in equations. </p>
                <p class="section-q"> <b>(5) As a high school student, what certifications do you have? </b></p>
                <p class="section-a"> I'm a certified tutor on schoolhouse.world in pre-algebra, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, pre-calculus, and calculus. I've worked with hundreds of clients — from elementary schoolers to undergraduates — and consulted independently with users on social media to answer questions, help with homework, and provide study resources. I obtained a 5 on the AP Calculus BC exam and am known as a first-hand resource for assistance, with many of my clients earning As in their classes. </p>
