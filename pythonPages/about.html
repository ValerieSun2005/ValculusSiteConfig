                    My name is Valerie (she/her).
                    I am a girlboss who loves math and science, is addicted to boba, and worships pumpkins!
                    I enjoy playing chess, skateboarding, mountain biking, and doing my nails.
                    I created this site to express my love for math
                    while establishing a central resource for AP Calculus students.
                    I firmly believe in the value of free, easily accessible education and its engaging presentation to students.
                    In the future I plan to become a physics teacher, but for now I tutor and maintain this site.
                    This site is structured like a textbook, with section notes and exercises, 
                    and includes practice AP exam problems—resources to assist any student in the class.
                </p>

                    All the content on this site is protected under the CC-BY-NC-SA license, 
                    which states that individuals may share or adapt my work for non-commerical purposes if they provide attribution.
                    In a classroom setting—such as students using the material to supplement their learning or instructors sharing 
                    problems—it's okay to use, share, and adapt these resources without giving credit. 
                    However, you must provide attribution for any other non-commercial use, such as on another website.
                    My goal is to enable access to education, so I'll only have a problem if my work is used for commercial purposes without my permission.
                    You can read more about my policies on my <a href="">Terms of Use</a> page.

                    I've thought a lot about the design for the site.
                    My goal was to form a simple layout to facilitate the learning environment, 
                    so I chose the font to be on the larger end (roughly 18 px on a 1080p screen). 
                    This large text creates the optimal length of lines, as our brains favor medium-length lines:
                    If a line is too long, our brains will just scan over it; 
                    if a line is too short, our brains will feel fatigued from the constant line-breaking.
                    I also elected to use the font Georgia because it's web-safe, promotes readability, and adds a zest of style!
                    Additionally, dark mode prevents eye strain, especially for late-night studying, 
                    and avoids any glare. Gen Z HATES light mode—I mean, it's a disgrace! 
                    There's a reason this style has become standard on virtually every social media app: 
                    because light mode is on its way out. 
                    Some polls have indicated that over \(80\) percent of people use dark mode on their devices, 
                    and one even showed that over \(60\) percent of consumers expect dark mode to be applied. 
                    I opted to use a dark-gray color because some users claim that black screens induce feelings of depression, 
                    and a too-dark background may also cause eye strain.
                    I love the color pink, so I've used it as often as possible, especially in links.
                    To display the math, I use MathJax, a clean, easy-to-install script in which I can type typeset math using LaTeX.
                    For the graphs, I draw them in a separate LaTeX document using the tikzpicture package and paste them into the section. 
                    I decided to present section exercises in a separate PDF file to encourage the reader to view them while reading the section notes. 
                    (It's also too much work for me to manage all those extra pages on the site.)
